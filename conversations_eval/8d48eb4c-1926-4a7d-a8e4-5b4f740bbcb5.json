      "text": "Based on your request for XLSX datasets of lake surface area in the Arctic between 1980 and 1990, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the exact datasets matching your specific criteria (Arctic lake surface area, 1980-1990, XLSX format) are not readily available in the retrieved files. However, I can provide some insights and potential alternatives:\n\n1. **Available Datasets**: While the datasets I found do not exactly match your criteria, they relate to lake and water surface areas, albeit in different contexts or locations. For example:\n   - **Pre SWOT Hydrology Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Area Extent V2**: This dataset, available from the PODAAC website, provides global lake and reservoir surface water extent from 2000 onwards, derived from MODIS instruments. Although it doesn't match your temporal or spatial criteria, it's a valuable resource for those interested in hydrology and global water dynamics.\n   - **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - Pupuke Lake Holocene Air and Lake Surface Temperature Reconstructions**: Offered by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, this study includes reconstructions of lake surface temperatures, though it focuses on Pupuke Lake and spans from approximately 16138 to 12 years before present, which doesn't align with your specified time frame or location.\n\n2. **Missing Information**: To better assist you, it would be helpful to know if you're looking for data from a specific Arctic lake or if there's a particular aspect of lake surface area (e.g., changes due to climate, water level fluctuations) you're interested in. Additionally, specifying a preferred data source or producer could narrow down the search.\n\n3. **Next Steps**: If you're flexible with the time frame or location, I can suggest exploring datasets like those mentioned above for broader insights into lake surface areas and hydrological changes. For more targeted data, considering alternative formats (e.g., CSV, shapefiles) might yield more results, as XLSX might be less common for large-scale hydrological datasets.\n\n4. **Alternative Datasets**: Some datasets, like the topographic digital surface models (DSM) for Whiskeytown Lake, are available and provide detailed information on lake and surrounding area elevations, which could be useful for hydrological studies, although they are not specific to the Arctic region or your specified time frame.\n\nTo proceed, please let me know if you'd like to adjust your search criteria, if there's a specific Arctic lake you're interested in, or if exploring alternative datasets and formats is an option for you."

      "description": "The Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Extent Mask Time Series are derived from the MODIS instruments. The purpose of this dataset is to provide surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs throughout the globe, with a base temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 meters. With the exception of periods of low-quality input data, these time series will extend across the lifespan of the MODIS multispectral reflectance products, from roughly 2000 to present. These time series will allow us to satisfy the project goal to produce ESDRs of suitable quality to support long-term trend analysis and global water dynamics models for the longest length possible (in most cases, about 20 years, the length of the altimetry record) of key measures of surface water storages and fluxes. This product should be accessible and of direct use to both water managers and the scientific community worldwide, and will allow for improved assessment and modeling of human impact on the global water cycle. These pre SWOT data are derived from satellites to provide hydrological measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will have hydrology as one of its objectives. This dataset does not have the same variables as SWOT, but does provide hydrological measurements with typical quality flagging typical of satellite data. Not only does it provide science information, it can also assist hydrological users new to satellite data with the satellite data formats and variables before SWOT launches.",

The acquisition flight was conducted by The 111th Group Aerial Photography, using a Hasselblad A6D-100c camera. The imagery was acquired from an approximate altitude of 880 meters (2,900 feet) above ground level, to produce a nominal ground sample distance (pixel size) of 5 centimeters (2 inches). An onboard dual-frequency GPS receiver was used to record the precise time and position of each image.

      "description": "Clear Lake is a 180 km2 freshwater lake located approximately 120 km northwest of Sacramento in the California Coast Range. The lake is a popular sport-fishing destination, however, there are fish consumption advisories associated with mercury (Hg) contamination for several species. The lake has three arms: a large open-water region to the northwest (Upper Arm), a smaller and narrower region to the southeast (Lower Arm), and the smallest and narrowest region to the east (Oaks Arm). The Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), located on the eastern shore of the Oaks Arm, was mined by underground methods starting in the 1870s and then open-pit methods during the 1920s to 1950s. Since 1992, the SBMM has been a Superfund site managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This former Hg mining area is thought to be the dominant contributor of Hg to Clear Lake and is the focus of continued remediation to minimize Hg impacts to Clear Lake. The SBMM area is an active geothermal area with springs and gas fumaroles. \nClear Lake is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, based on elevated concentrations of nutrients (various forms of nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) that cause excessive algal blooms and periodic fish kills. There are current studies underway (by the University of California, Davis, UCD) to improve the understanding of nutrient cycling within the lake. The UCD group is developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic computer model (https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Blue-Ribbon-Committee-for-the-Rehabilitation-of-Clear-Lake/2022-BRC-Annual-Report-_20230110_DraftFinal.pdf ) of the lake that simulates periodic stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as nutrient dynamics. An effort is planned during 2023-2025 to add mercury cycling to the 3-D model. Monitoring and modeling efforts are being implemented to improve understanding of the ways that nutrient dynamics affect the cycling, transport and bioaccumulation of Hg, which remains poorly understood. \nThis data release documents the results of water-quality sampling during June 2020 through June 2022. It includes three data tables given as machine readable 'comma-separated values' format (*.csv):  1) ‘T1_CL_DataDictionary’, the Data Dictionary, which provides definitions and details related to the other two data tables and includes citations of analytical methods; 2) ‘T2_CL_Discrete_SW’, the discrete-sample surface-water dataset including concentration data for Hg species (including total mercury and methylmercury in dissolved and particulate forms) and nutrients (including several forms of N and P); and 3) ‘T3_CL_QA_SW’, a quality assurance data summary for the discrete water samples. In addition, file ‘Clear Lake Coordinates_SW 2020-22_052324’ provides the sampling locations in a machine-readable geospatial file format (*.kmz).",
