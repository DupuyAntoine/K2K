      "text": "You are looking for JSON datasets related to solar radiation in Africa, specifically covering the period between 2015 and 2023. After conducting a search, several relevant datasets were found, although none directly match your specific criteria of being in JSON format and focused solely on Africa. However, these datasets could be useful or adaptable for your needs:\n\n1. **National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)**: While primarily focused on the United States, the NSRDB also includes data for international locations, potentially covering parts of Africa. It offers hourly and half-hourly values of global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance, along with meteorological data. The dataset is updated annually and provides foundational information for solar energy systems. You can find more information at [https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/) and [https://registry.opendata.aws/nrel-pds-nsrdb/](https://registry.opendata.aws/nrel-pds-nsrdb/).\n\n2. **Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN)**: This dataset includes solar irradiances and is part of a project aimed at monitoring solar radiation. Although not exclusive to Africa, it could contain relevant data points within the continent. The data is available at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn) and [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrncalc](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrncalc) for calculated solar irradiances.\n\n3. **Solar and Infrared Radiation Station (SIRS)**: Offers data on broadband shortwave and longwave radiation, which could be pertinent for solar radiation studies. The dataset is accessible at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs) and [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs60s](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs60s) for 60-second data.\n\nGiven that none of these datasets are specifically in JSON format or exclusively focused on Africa, you may need to either convert the data format or filter the data to fit your geographic requirements. It's also worth noting that detailed spatial resolution (e.g., country or grid level) and the specific type of solar radiation data (e.g., incoming, outgoing, surface) could help narrow down the search for more precise datasets.\n\nIf these options do not meet your needs, please provide more details on the specific requirements, such as the desired spatial resolution or the exact type of solar radiation data you're interested in, to help refine the search."

At the heart of this was a carefully stacked Twin Otter and Egrett cloud sandwich with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 feet and the Egrett at 43,000 feet overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000 feet.",

The current NSRDB is modeled using multi-channel measurements from geostationary satellites. The older versions of the NSRDB were modeled using cloud and weather information primarily collected at airports. A sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales were used to represent regional solar radiation climates accurately.",

      "description": "The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2023. The NSRDB is updated annually and provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy programs, research, industry and the general public.\n\nThe NSRDB provides time-series data at 30-minute resolution of resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. Additionally time series data at 5 minutes for the US and 10 minutes for North, Central and South America at 2 km resolution are produced from the next generation of GOES satellites and made available from 2019. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI). The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to compute GHI and FARMS DNI is used to compute the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The PATMOS-X model uses radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of geostationary weather satellites. Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g., aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from NASA's Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to compute PV generation.",
