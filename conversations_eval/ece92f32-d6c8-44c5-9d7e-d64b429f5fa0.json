      "text": "I've conducted a search for XLSX datasets related to glacier mass balance in Europe between 1980 and 1990. Unfortunately, the initial search did not yield exact matches that meet all your specified criteria, including the specific time frame and geographic location. \n\nHowever, I can provide information on relevant datasets that might be useful for your research, although they may not perfectly match your request:\n\n1. **Glacier Mass Balance and Regime Measurements and Analysis, 1945-2003**: This dataset, available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, includes annual mass balances, ablation, accumulation, and equilibrium-line altitude of mountain and subpolar glaciers outside the two major ice sheets. While it covers a broader time period than your request, it does include data relevant to European glaciers.\n\n2. **USGS Benchmark Glacier Mass Balance and Project Data**: The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains long-term glacier mass-balance programs at several glaciers. Although the primary focus is on North American glaciers, understanding the methodologies and data types can be beneficial for comparative studies or methodology applications in European contexts.\n\n3. **Glacier-Wide Mass Balance and Compiled Data Inputs: Juneau Icefield Glaciers**: This dataset provides glacier-wide mass balance solutions and input data for Taku and Lemon Creek Glaciers. While geographically outside Europe, it offers insights into glacier mass balance calculations and could be useful for comparative or methodological purposes.\n\nFor datasets specifically focused on European glaciers between 1980 and 1990 in XLSX format, I recommend checking scientific publications, government reports, or environmental agencies' websites that focus on glaciology and climate change research. The World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) and the European Environment Agency (EEA) might have relevant data or direct you to specific studies or datasets that match your criteria.\n\nIf you could provide more information on the specific aspects of glacier mass balance you're interested in (e.g., accumulation, ablation, equilibrium line altitude) or any particular European region, I might be able to offer more targeted suggestions or alternatives."

      "description": "Since the late 1950s, the USGS has maintained a long-term glacier mass-balance program at three North American glaciers. Measurements began on South Cascade Glacier, WA in 1958, expanding to Gulkana and Wolverine glaciers, AK in 1966, and later Sperry Glacier, MT in 2005. Additional measurements have been made on Lemon Creek Glacier, AK to compliment data collected by the Juneau Icefield Research Program (JIRP; Pelto and others, 2013). Direct field measurements of point glaciological data are combined with weather and geodetic data to estimate the seasonal and annual mass balance at each glacier in both a conventional and reference surface format (Cogley and others, 2011). The analysis framework (O'Neel, 2019; prior to v 3.0 van Beusekom and others, 2010) is identical at each glacier to enable cross-comparison between output time series.

      "description": "Natural attenuation of organic contaminants in groundwater can give rise to a series of complex biogeochemical reactions that release secondary contaminants to groundwater. In a crude oil contaminated aquifer, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons is coupled with the reduction of ferric iron (Fe(III)) hydroxides in aquifer sediments. As a result, naturally occurring arsenic (As), adsorbed to Fe(III) hydroxides in the aquifer sediment, is mobilized from sediment into groundwater. However, Fe(III) in sediment of other zones of the aquifer has the capacity to attenuate dissolved As via re-sorption. To better evaluate how long-term biodegradation coupled with Fe-reduction and As mobilization can redistribute As mass in contaminated aquifer, we quantified mass partitioning of Fe and As in the aquifer based on field observation data. Results show that Fe and As are spatially correlated in both groundwater and aquifer sediments. Mass partitioning calculations demonstrate that 99.9% of Fe and 99.5% of As are associated with aquifer sediment. The sediments act as both sources and sinks for As, depending on the redox conditions in the aquifer. Calculations reveal that at least 78% of the original As mass in sediment near the oil has been mobilized into groundwater over the 35-year lifespan of the plume. However, the calculations also show that only a small percentage of As mass (~0.5%) remains in groundwater, due to resorption onto sediment. At the leading edge of the plume, where groundwater is suboxic, sediments sequester Fe and As, causing As to accumulate to concentrations 5.6 times greater than background concentrations. However, current arsenic sinks can serve as future sources of arsenic as the plume evolves over time. The mass balance approach used in this study can is applicable to As cycling in other aquifers where groundwater As results from biodegradation of an organic carbon point source coupled with Fe reduction.",

      "description": "This data release includes glacier wide mass balance solutions for Taku and Lemon Creek Glaciers, as well as the refined inputs used in these calculations. Input data are of three types: 1) time-variable area altitude distribution (AAD); 2) time series of point water balance at long term sites (with secondary sites given in recent years); 3) weather data from nearby stations, either installed along the glacier margins or taken from a nearby site if continuous glacier-adjacent data is unavailable. The USGS runs a coded analysis to transform the three input data types to the output glacier-wide data. Output data represent surface mass balance estimates. The output solution is a geodetically calibrated, conventional glacier-wide mass balance, which represents our preferred solution. Conventional glacier-wide mass balance from direct observations without calibration can be easily derived by using the geodetic calibration coefficients provided, if desired. We do not explicitly account for basal or englacial accumulation or ablation. Mass balances are reported in water equivalent (w.e.) units, and often represent integration of multiple field measurements. Whenever possible, we average multiple field measurements to account for surface roughness and measurement errors. Additional data for Lemon Creek Glacier, part of the Juneau Icefield, is available in a separate data release of USGS Benchmark Glacier mass balance data at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7HD7SRF  It is not included here to avoid duplication.\n      Preliminary mass balance estimates for the current calendar year are provided, but do not include direct measurements of ablation after the date of the fall visit.
