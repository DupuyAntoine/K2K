      "text": "I've searched for datasets related to the NDVI vegetation index over the Sahel region between 1998 and 2020. Based on your request, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your needs.\n\nThe datasets I've found contain NDVI data from various sources, including satellite imagery from Landsat and AVHRR. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Global Vegetation Greenness (NDVI) from AVHRR GIMMS-3G+**: This dataset provides global NDVI data from 1981 to 2022, including the Sahel region. The data is available in NetCDF format and has a spatial resolution of 0.0833 degrees.\n2. **NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of VIIRS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)**: This dataset contains daily NDVI data from 2014 to present, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. While it doesn't cover the entire time period you requested, it might be useful for more recent data.\n3. **Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) Phenology NDVI Yearly Global 0.05Deg CMG**: This dataset provides yearly NDVI data from 1981 to 2014, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. It's available in HDF-EOS format.\n\nThese datasets were selected because they provide NDVI data for the Sahel region, although the exact spatial coverage and time period might vary.

The data was generated with machine-learning techniques (i.e., regression tree [RT]) and harmonized Landsat and Sentinel -2 (HLS) data. The geographic coverage includes areas in the Great Basin, the Snake River Plain, the state of Wyoming, and contiguous areas.

      "description": "These operational land imager (OLI) value added data sets, maps, and associated ancillary data were compiled as part of an ongoing research aimed at quantifying the riparian vegetation greenness and water use in the lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico. In order to create trend and anomaly maps that characterize these ecosystems Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series imagery from Landsat OLI were acquired and processed over time and space along seven predefined reaches that capture different natural states and management conditions.\nWe used Landsat OLI 30m data as an improvement upon past studies that were based on coarser remote sensing data from the NASA MODIS sensor (250 m). The OLI 30m images provide better characterization and performance over these rather narrow riparian corridors. To capture the change over time we used a simple differencing technique that compares two annual average growing season VI cycles (limited to May-October).  These anomaly maps capture how the corridor vegetation health responds to both natural and anthropogenic changes.  We limited this study to the full OLI record (2013-2019) since we were interested in understanding the response to Minute 319 pulse flow of 2014. The difference maps are an ideal tool for capturing how the released water impacted vegetation immediately and over long time.\nThe Minute 319 pulse flow science team in collaboration with the University of Arizona have developed a data processing system to support this effort with focus on understanding how the riparian corridor is responding to these natural and anthropogenic stressors.\nAll data associated with this project were acquired from the LP-DAAC and pre-processed to remove and capture issues prior to further processing (see below) which involved reprojection to a common projection, masking to only retain the area of interest, quality analysis to discard poor data, and then value addition to generate the NDVI and the difference maps.  The data acquisition and analysis were performed at the University of Arizona VIP lab (vip.arizona.edu) using their large Linux cluster of computing and storage resources.  A mix of off the shelf software and specialized in-house tools were used to carry the different steps and analyses.",

      "description": "The NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments ([MEaSUREs](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/about/competitive-programs/measures)) Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) global datasets were created using surface reflectance data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) N07, N09, N11, and N14 datasets (1981 – 1999) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra MOD09 surface reflectance data (2000 - 2014).  The VIP Vegetation Index (VI) product was developed to provide consistent measurements of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and modified Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) spanning more than 30 years of data from multiple sensors. The EVI2 is a backward extension of AVHRR. Vegetation indices such as NDVI and EVI2 are useful for assessing the biophysical properties of the land surface, and are used to characterize vegetation phenology. Phenology tracks the seasonal life cycle of vegetation, and provides information on the biotic response to environmental changes. The VIPPHEN data product is provided globally at 0.05 degree (5600 meter) spatial resolution in geographic (Lat/Lon) grid format. The data are stored in Hierarchical Data Format-Earth Observing System (HDF-EOS) file format. The VIPPHEN phenology product contains 26 Science Datasets (SDS) which include phenological metrics such as the start, peak, and end of season as well as the rate of greening and senescence. The product also provides the maximum, average, and background calculated VIs. The VIPPHEN SDS are based on the daily VIP product series and are calculated using a 3-year moving window average to smooth out noise in the data. A reliability SDS is included to provide context on the quality of the input data.",

Rock detention and earthen berm structures were built on the Cienega San Bernardino over the course of four decades, beginning in 1984 and continuing to the present. Previous research findings show that restoration supports and even increases vegetation health despite ongoing drought conditions in this arid watershed. However, the extent of restoration impacts is still unknown despite qualitative observations of improvement in surrounding vegetation amount and vigor. We analyzed spatial and temporal trends in vegetation greenness and soil moisture by applying the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) to one dry summer season Landsat path/row from 1984 to 2016. The study area was divided into zones and spectral data for each zone was analyzed and compared with precipitation record using statistical measures including linear regression, Mann– Kendall test, and linear correlation. NDVI and NDII performed differently due to the presence of continued grazing and the effects of grazing on canopy cover; NDVI was better able to track changes in vegetation in areas without grazing while NDII was better at tracking changes in areas with continued grazing. Restoration impacts display higher greenness and vegetation water content levels, greater increases in greenness and water content through time, and a decoupling of vegetation greenness and water content from spring precipitation when compared to control sites in nearby tributary and upland areas. Our results confirm the potential of erosion control structures to affect areas up to 5 km downstream of restoration sites over time and to affect 1 km upstream of the sites.",
