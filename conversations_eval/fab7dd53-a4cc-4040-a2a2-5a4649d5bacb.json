NOyO3 provides fast-response, specific, high precision, and calibrated measurements of nitrogen oxides and ozone at a spatial resolution of better than 100 m. ATom deploys an extensive gas and aerosol payload on the NASA DC-8 aircraft for systematic, global-scale sampling of the atmosphere, profiling continuously from 0.2 to 12 km altitude. Flights occurred in each of 4 seasons from 2016 to 2018. Flights originate from the Armstrong Flight Research Center in Palmdale, California, fly north to the western Arctic, south to the South Pacific, east to the Atlantic, north to Greenland, and return to California across central North America. ATom establishes a single, contiguous, global-scale dataset. This comprehensive dataset will be used to improve the representation of chemically reactive gases and short-lived climate forcers in global models of atmospheric chemistry and climate.",

The Ozone Water Vapor Group conducts research on the nature and causes of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer and the role of stratospheric and tropospheric ozone and water vapor in forcing climate change and in modifying the chemical cleaning capacity of the atmosphere. This is accomplished through long-term observations and intensive field programs that measure ozone and water vapor levels in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. The Reference Network used by the Ozone and Water Vapor Group is part of NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, CO. The measurement programs include Total Column Ozone Measurements (Dobson Ozone), Surface Ozone Measurements, Ozonesonde Measurements using balloons, and Water Vapor measurements using balloons. \n\nAn ozonesonde is a lightweight, balloon-borne instrument that is mated to a conventional meteorological radiosonde. As the balloon ascends through the atmosphere it sends information on ozone and standard meteorological quantities (air temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) back to a ground receiving station. The balloon is able to ascend to altitudes of about 115,000 feet (35 km) in about two hours before it will burst. Ozonesonde are launched approximately weekly from 9 locations including American Samoa, Antarctica, Greenland, Fiji, and the United States (Alabama, California, Colorado, Hawaii, and Rhode Island). The data have been collected since 1967.",

      "description": "POAM2_VER6 data are Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement II Version 6.0 data. The Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement (POAM) II instrument measures the vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and aerosol extinction. The instrument was developed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).POAM II measures solar extinction in nine narrow band channels, covering the spectral range from approximately 350 to 1060 nm. Solar extinction by the atmosphere is measured using the solar occultation technique; the sun is observed through the Earth's atmosphere as it rises and sets as viewed from the satellite.POAM II was launched aboard the French SPOT-3 satellite on 26 September, 1993 into a Sun synchronous polar orbit. As seen from the satellite, the Sun rises in the north polar region and sets in the south polar region 14.2 times per day. Sunrise measurements are made in a latitude band from 55-71 degrees north while sunsets occur between 63-88 degrees south. The POAM II mission was interrupted by the failure of the SPOT-3 satellite in November of 1996.Each data granule contains one month of data for a particular hemisphere, taken at approximately 101 minute intervals. The latitudinal extent of data for the northern hemisphere is 54.68 to 71.01 and -62.55 to -88.11 for the southern hemisphere. The longitude ranges from 0 to 360. Several images in 'gif' format are also available. The images represent daily average ozone (altitude .vs. time) for the northern and southern hemispheres, daily average aerosol extinction for the southern hemisphere and latitudinal limits of data samples are also provided. The data consists of profiles of ozone and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration and aerosol extinction at 1.06um.",

The measurement programs include Total Column Ozone Measurements (Dobson Ozone), Surface Ozone Measurements, Ozonesonde Measurements using balloons, and Water Vapor measurements using balloons. \n\nSince 1980, the Ozone and Water Vapor group has made in situ measurements of atmospheric water vapor mixing ratios (mole fractions) from the lower free troposphere (~2 km) up to the middle stratosphere (~28 km). These measurements are made using a balloon-borne payload including a NOAA frost point hygrometer, an electrochemical concentration cell, ozonesonde, and a radiosonde to measure temperature, pressure, and payload location via GPS. The payloads are built and calibrated in the laboratory in Boulder, CO.  These hygrometers are flown monthly from Boulder to Hilo, Hawaii and Lauder, New Zealand. The primary research focus is the long-term monitoring of upper tropospheric and lower stratospheric water vapor and the processes that control its abundance in the atmosphere. Water vapor is a natural and important component of the Earth's atmosphere. The distribution of water vapor influences physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere (weather, clouds, precipitation, radiation balance, convective uplift, lightning generation, and ozone chemistry) as well as its effects on the Earth's energy budget. Variations in the amounts of water vapor in the atmosphere are natural and normal, but changes in its vertical distribution may be indicative of changes in the Earth's climate which is of great interest.",
