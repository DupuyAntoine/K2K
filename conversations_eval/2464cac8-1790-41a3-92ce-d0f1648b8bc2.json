      "text": "Based on your request for GEOJSON datasets of solar radiation in Africa between 2015 and 2023, I have conducted a search to find relevant data that matches your criteria. \n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not yield datasets that exactly match your request for solar radiation data in Africa, specifically in GEOJSON format, for the years 2015-2023. However, I can suggest some datasets that might be useful or closely related to what you're looking for:\n\n1. **National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)**: While not exclusively focused on Africa, this database provides a comprehensive collection of solar radiation data, including global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance, for the United States and a growing list of international locations from 1998-2023. It might be worth exploring if they have any data relevant to your query.\n   - URL: https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/\n   - URL (Alternative): https://registry.opendata.aws/nrel-pds-nsrdb/\n\n2. **Solar and Infrared Radiation Station (SIRS)**: This dataset, although not in GEOJSON format, contains information on broadband shortwave and longwave radiation, which might be of interest if you're looking into aspects of solar radiation.\n   - URL: http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs\n\n3. **Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN)**: Offers data on solar irradiances, which could be relevant depending on the specifics of what you're researching.\n   - URL: http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn\n\n4. **30-m Potential Solar Radiation (2014)**: Although this dataset is not within your specified timeframe (2015-2023) and focuses on the United States, it demonstrates the type of solar radiation data that is available and might suggest where to look for similar data for Africa.\n   - URL: https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/543497?Reference=2208716\n\nTo find a dataset that more closely matches your requirements, I recommend the following steps:\n- Check the websites of major data providers like NASA, NOAA, or the European Space Agency for datasets related to solar radiation in Africa.\n- Consider reaching out to research institutions or universities in Africa that might have conducted studies on solar radiation and could provide or point you towards relevant datasets.\n- If the specific format (GEOJSON) is not a strict requirement, look for datasets in other formats (like CSV, NetCDF) that could be converted to GEOJSON for your needs.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any other way I can assist you in finding the data you need or if you have any follow-up questions."

ARESE used a combination of satellite, aircraft, and ground observations to make highly accurate solar flux measurements at different altitudes throughout the atmospheric column. At the heart of this was a carefully stacked Twin Otter and Egrett cloud sandwich with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 feet and the Egrett at 43,000 feet overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000 feet.",

      "description": "The NSRDB is a serially complete collection of hourly and half-hourly values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation—global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance—and meteorological data. The current NSRDB is modeled using multi-channel measurements from geostationary satellites. The older versions of the NSRDB were modeled using cloud and weather information primarily collected at airports. A sufficient number of locations and temporal and spatial scales were used to represent regional solar radiation climates accurately.",

      "description": "The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2023. The NSRDB is updated annually and provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy programs, research, industry and the general public.\n\nThe NSRDB provides time-series data at 30-minute resolution of resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. Additionally time series data at 5 minutes for the US and 10 minutes for North, Central and South America at 2 km resolution are produced from the next generation of GOES satellites and made available from 2019. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI). The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to compute GHI and FARMS DNI is used to compute the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The PATMOS-X model uses radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of geostationary weather satellites. Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g., aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from NASA's Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to compute PV generation.",
