      "text": "You are looking for land surface temperature data for Africa in 2015. After conducting a thorough search, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your query. However, it seems that none of the retrieved datasets specifically focus on Africa for the year 2015.\n\nHere are a few datasets that contain land surface temperature data and might be of interest:\n\n1. **International Surface Temperature Initiative (ISTI) Global Land Surface Temperature Databank - Stage 3 Monthly**: This dataset contains monthly timescale mean, maximum, and minimum temperature for approximately 40,000 stations globally, including some in Africa. It covers data from the 1800s to present and is available at [https://doi.org/10.7289/V5PK0D3G](https://doi.org/10.7289/V5PK0D3G).\n2. **Land Surface Temperature July 2015**: Although not exclusively focused on Africa, this dataset provides estimated land surface temperature for July 16, 2015, based on Landsat 8 imagery. It can be found at [https://opendata.dc.gov/documents/DCGIS::land-surface-temperature-july-2015](https://opendata.dc.gov/documents/DCGIS::land-surface-temperature-july-2015).\n\nTo narrow down the search, could you please provide more details on the specific requirements for the land surface temperature data, such as the desired format (e.g., CSV, JSON) or any preferred data source? Additionally, are you looking for data from a particular region within Africa or a specific time frame within 2015? This information will help in refining the search to find the most suitable dataset for your needs."
