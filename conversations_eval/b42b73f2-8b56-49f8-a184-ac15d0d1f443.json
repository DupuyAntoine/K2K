      "text": "Based on your query for NETCDF datasets of aerosol optical depth in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000, I have searched through our database to provide you with relevant datasets. \n\nUnfortunately, the exact datasets matching your criteria (NETCDF format, aerosol optical depth, Antarctica, 1990-2000) are not immediately available in our current database. However, I can suggest some alternatives and similar datasets that might be useful for your research:\n\n1. **NIMFR: derived total & aerosol optical depth from 1st Michalsky algorithm**: This dataset, although not specifically limited to Antarctica or the exact time frame, provides aerosol optical depth data that could be useful. It's available at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::nimfraod1mich.\n\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths** and **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, NIR Aerosol Optical Depths**: These datasets offer aerosol optical depth measurements but are not restricted to Antarctica. They can be found at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sashevisaod and http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sasheniraod, respectively.\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001**: This dataset contains monthly mean MODIS Level 3 data from aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) at a spatial resolution of 1º by 1º. While it's focused on High Mountain Asia and not Antarctica, it might be useful for comparative studies or methodological approaches. It's available through https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FD0SO1YA0B9EY.\n\n4. **MODIS/Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, **MODIS/Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, and **MODIS/Terra+Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**: These datasets provide near-real-time aerosol optical depth data from MODIS sensors on the Terra and Aqua satellites. They are not limited to Antarctica but offer global coverage, including aerosol optical depth measurements. These can be accessed through https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt.\n\nTo find more specific datasets matching your criteria, I recommend checking the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) or the NASA Earthdata portal, which often host a wide range of datasets related to atmospheric conditions, including aerosol optical depth measurements over Antarctica.\n\nIf you have any more specific information about the producer or the exact dataset you're looking for, or if you'd like to consider datasets with auxiliary variables related to aerosol optical depth, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
