      "text": "I've searched for datasets that match your request for precipitation totals in Asia between 1990 and 2000 in CSV format. Although I couldn't find exact matches, I've retrieved some relevant datasets that might be helpful for your research.\n\n1. **Monthly Precipitation Totals 1939-2015**: This dataset, available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provides monthly precipitation totals for the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. While it's not exclusive to Asia, it does offer a long-term record of precipitation that could be useful for comparative studies. You can download it from [https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/DownloadFile/58582?Reference=57628](https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/DownloadFile/58582?Reference=57628).\n\n2. **Total Precipitation Sensor**: Although this dataset from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Archive doesn't specify a geographic location, it does provide total precipitation sensor data that could be relevant for understanding precipitation patterns. It's available at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::tps](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::tps).\n\n3. **GPM GROUND VALIDATION TOTAL PRECIPITATION SENSOR (HOTPLATE) GCPEX V1**: This dataset from NASA's Earthdata repository contains measurements of liquid precipitation rate and accumulation for snow, among other parameters, collected during the GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) in Ontario, Canada. It might not be directly applicable to Asia but offers insights into precipitation measurement techniques. You can find it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpmtpshpgcpex](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpmtpshpgcpex).\n\n4. **Total Precipitable Water (TPW) CPEX**: Another dataset related to water vapor, this one includes products from the MetOp-B, NOAA-18, and NOAA-19 satellites, collected during the NASA Convective Processes Experiment (CPEX) in the North Atlantic-Gulf of America-Caribbean Sea region. While not focused on Asia, it contributes to global understanding of water vapor and precipitation processes. It's available for download from [https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2005-018A](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=2005-018A).\n\n5. **Oregon Average Annual Total Precipitation 1991-2020**: This dataset, although specific to Oregon, provides spatially gridded average annual total precipitation data that could serve as a reference for understanding precipitation patterns in other regions. It's downloadable from [https://geohub.oregon.gov/documents/oregon-geo::oregon-average-annual-total-precipitation-1991-2020](https://geohub.oregon.gov/documents/oregon-geo::oregon-average-annual-total-precipitation-1991-2020).\n\nTo better assist you, could you please specify which countries or regions within Asia you are interested in? Additionally, do you have a preferred source or producer for the precipitation datasets? This information will help narrow down the search to provide more targeted results."

The 1 degree TPW dataset is a merged ocean product constructed using version 7 (V7) passive microwave geophysical ocean products made publicly available by RSS (www.remss.com). TPW values for this dataset were acquired from the following satellite microwave radiometers: SSM/I F08 through F15, SSMIS F16 and F17, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat. The radiometers used to construct this dataset were were inter-calibrated at the brightness temperature level, while the V7 ocean products were produced using a consistent processing methodology across sensors.",

      "description": "NVAP_OCEAN_Total-Precipitable-Water data set includes only data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and intends to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets. The data set is used for studies of climate change, interannual variability, and independent comparison to other ocean-only data sets. The new NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) data sets are produced under the NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program and is named NVAP-M. It supersedes the previous NVAP data set. NVAP-M continues the legacy of providing high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The use of improved, intercalibrated data sets and algorithms that were not available for the heritage NVAP data set results in an improved and extended water vapor data set that is stable enough for climate research and of a resolution appropriate for studies on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The true value of NVAP-M will be seen in outcomes from applied and research users of the data set in various fields. Some initial NVAP-M findings are presented in Vonder Haar et al. (2012). In addition to the time-dependent artifacts present in the previous NVAP data set, a wealth of new data has become available since the last NVAP processing in 2003. These include an additional SSM/I instrument, additional NOAA satellites, the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)-Aqua Satellite, which carries the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well as water vapor information from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. This extension and reprocessing effort increases the temporal coverage from 14 to 22 (1988-2009) years, making the data set more useful and consistent for investigation of the long-term trends which are hypothesized to occur as Earth warms. In addition to the long-standing daily, 1-degree gridded Total Precipitable Water (TPW) and layered Precipitable Water (PW) products, NVAP-M includes additional products geared towards different scientific needs. Three separate processing streams produced products directed towards specific research goals. These are NVAP-M Climate, designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications, and NVAP-M Weather, designed to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution products for use in studies on shorter time scales as well as weather case studies. Additionally, an ocean-only (NVAP-M Ocean) version includes only data from the SSM/I and is intended to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets.",
