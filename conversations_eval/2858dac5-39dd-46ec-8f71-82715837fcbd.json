      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of carbon emissions in North America between 2010 and 2020, I've found several datasets that may be relevant to your needs.\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel. Although it's not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it does offer insights into CO2 emissions from various sectors. You can access this data at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**: The Hestia Project quantifies, simulates, and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions. This dataset for Indianapolis provides data at the county level (200 m grid resolution) and at hourly and yearly time frames from 2010 to 2015. You can find more information and download the data at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341).\n\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: This dataset from NASA provides estimates of hourly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels at 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States. It covers emissions from ten distinct source sectors and is available from 2012 through 2017. The data is provided in NetCDF version 4 format and can be accessed at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n\n4. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations at sub-county resolutions and annual/hourly time scales for various U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and the Baltimore/Washington Region. The data builds upon the Vulcan Project, which grids U.S. national emissions, and is available from 2010 for select cities. You can explore this dataset further at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nEach of these datasets was selected because it offers unique insights into carbon emissions within North America, albeit with slightly different focuses and resolutions. For direct CSV downloads, some datasets might require registration or contacting the data providers, as the links provided often lead to dataset descriptions or landing pages where you can find more detailed information and instructions for accessing the data.\n\nIf you're looking for something more specific or if these datasets do not fully meet your requirements, please provide additional details such as the specific type of carbon emissions you're interested in (e.g., CO2 from transportation or industrial sectors) or a particular geographic area within North America. This will help in narrowing down the search for the most relevant datasets."
