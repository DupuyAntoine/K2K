      "text": "I've conducted a search based on your request for XLS datasets related to snow cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean between 2010 and 2020. While snow cover extent is more commonly associated with land areas, I've found some datasets that might be relevant to your query, focusing on the broader context of snow and ice extent which could tangentially relate to the Atlantic Ocean, especially in terms of sea ice extent.\n\n1. **Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent, September 1980 Onward, Version 1**: This dataset provides weekly snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere in NetCDF format from September 1980 through the most recent processing at a 24 km resolution. Although it's not specifically focused on the Atlantic Ocean and is in NetCDF format, it could be useful for understanding broader patterns in snow cover extent that might influence or be related to Atlantic Ocean conditions. [Download from NOAA](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10035/).\n\n2. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: This dataset offers monthly snow cover extent for North America derived from weekly values, which might be of interest if you're looking at the interface between land and sea in terms of snow and ice coverage. However, it does not specifically focus on the Atlantic Ocean. [Access through NOAA](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html).\n\n3. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent, Version 4**: This dataset includes weekly snow cover and sea ice extent for the Northern Hemisphere, which directly involves the Atlantic Ocean in terms of sea ice extent. The data is provided in a grid cell size of 25 x 25 km. While not exclusively focused on the Atlantic, it covers a broad area including parts of the ocean. [Available from NSIDC](https://daacdata.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/nsidc0046_weekly_snow_seaice/).\n\nUnfortunately, none of these datasets are in XLS format or specifically focused on the Atlantic Ocean's snow cover extent, as snow cover is typically measured over land. For sea ice extent in the Atlantic, the mentioned datasets might be more directly relevant. If you're looking for data specifically in XLS format, you might consider converting the provided datasets from their original format to XLS, though this would require ensuring that the conversion does not alter the data's integrity or accuracy.\n\nGiven the specifics of your request, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the parameters, as snow cover extent is not typically a metric applied to ocean areas like the Atlantic Ocean but rather to land surfaces. If your interest lies in sea ice extent within the Atlantic or related datasets, the provided information should be helpful. For more precise data or further clarification, please let me know how I can assist you further."

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",

      "description": "This dataset provides estimates of maximum snow cover extent (SCE) and snow depth for each 8-day composite period from 2001 to 2017 at 1 km resolution across Alaska. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas covered by perennial ice/snow or open water. A downscaling scheme was used in which Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis 0.5 degree snow depth data were interpolated to a finer 1 km spatial grid.  In the methods used, the downscaling scheme incorporated MODIS SCE (MOD10A2) to better account for the influence of local topography on the 1km snow distribution patterns.  For MODIS cloud-contaminated pixels, persistent and patchy cloud cover conditions were improved by applying an elevation-based spatial filtering algorithm to predict snow occurrence.  Cloud-free MODIS SCE data were then used to downscale MERRA-2 snow depth data.  For each snow-covered 1 km pixel indicated by the MODIS data, the snow depth was estimated based on the snow depth of the neighboring MERRA-2 0.5 grid cell, with weights predicted using a spatial filter.",

The land cover classification maps feature between three and six classes common to mountainous regions and integral for accurate stereo snow depth mapping: illuminated snow, shaded snow, vegetation, exposed surfaces, surface water, and clouds. Also included are Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA map products. The source imagery for these data are the Maxar WorldView-2 and Maxar WorldView-3 Level-1B 8-band multispectral images, orthorectified and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance.
