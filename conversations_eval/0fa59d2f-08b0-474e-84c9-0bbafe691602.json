      "text": "You are looking for JSON datasets of sea surface height anomalies in North America, covering the period from 2010 to 2020. Based on your request, I have found several datasets that may be relevant to your search.\n\nThe following datasets were selected because they contain sea surface height anomaly data, are available in JSON format or can be converted to JSON, and cover the specified geographic and temporal range:\n\n1. **Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry**: Provided by NOAA CoastWatch, this dataset contains daily sea surface height anomalies from 2017 to present. Although it doesn't fully cover your requested time period, it does include data from 2017 onwards and is available in a format that can be easily converted to JSON. You can access this dataset at [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html).\n\n2. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: This dataset, available from NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC), provides gridded sea surface height anomalies above a mean sea surface on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days. It covers a broader time period and can be filtered for the North American region. The data can be accessed at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\n3. **ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3B Daily and Monthly Gridded Polar Sea Surface Height Anomaly V003**: While this dataset from NASA focuses on polar regions, it includes daily and monthly gridded sea surface height anomalies that might be relevant for parts of North America, especially the northern areas. It's available at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FATLAS%2FATL21.003](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FATLAS%2FATL21.003).\n\n4. **NASA-SSH PDO Sea Surface Height Indicator**: This dataset contains an indicator for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) based on satellite observations of sea surface height anomaly. It's useful for understanding broader oceanic trends that could affect North America. Find it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C3484829347-POCLOUD](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/granules?p=C3484829347-POCLOUD).\n\nTo download or access these datasets, please follow the provided links. Some datasets might require registration or specific software to view and manipulate the data. If you find that these datasets do not fully meet your needs, additional filtering or processing might be necessary to extract the specific sea surface height anomalies for North America between 2010 and 2020.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on accessing these datasets."

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction.
