      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of solar radiation in Africa between 2015 and 2023, I've searched through our database to find relevant datasets that match your criteria. Although the search yielded several datasets related to solar radiation, not all of them specifically focus on Africa or provide data within the exact timeframe you've requested. However, here are a few datasets that could be useful for your research:\n\n1. **National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB)**: This database, provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), contains serially complete collections of hourly and half-hourly values of solar radiation measurements, including global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal irradiance, along with meteorological data. While it primarily focuses on the United States, there are growing collections of international data, including some African countries. The dataset is available from 1998 to 2023, which covers your requested timeframe. You can find more information and download the data at [https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/).\n\n2. **Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN)**: BSRN provides high-quality measurements of solar and infrared radiation. Although not exclusively focused on Africa, some of its stations are located on the continent, offering detailed radiation data that could be useful for your research. The data is available in various formats, but you might need to inquire specifically about CSV formats and the timeframe of interest. More details can be found at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn).\n\n3. **Solar and Infrared Radiation Station (SIRS)**: Similar to BSRN, SIRS offers data on solar and infrared radiation. With some stations potentially located in or near Africa, this dataset could offer insights into solar radiation patterns within your specified geographic area. However, specific details about CSV availability and the exact timeframe coverage would need to be confirmed. You can explore this dataset further at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sirs).\n\nTo better assist you, I would like to clarify a few points:\n- Are you looking for a specific type of solar radiation data (e.g., incoming solar radiation, solar irradiance)?\n- Would you prefer the data to be aggregated at a specific geographic level (e.g., country-level, regional)?\n- Are there any particular African countries or regions you are most interested in?\n\nGiven the global nature of solar radiation datasets and the specificity of your request, it might be helpful to consult directly with the data providers or research institutions that focus on African climate and solar radiation studies. They might offer more targeted data or guidance on where to find the exact information you're looking for."

ARESE used a combination of satellite, aircraft, and ground observations to make highly accurate solar flux measurements at different altitudes throughout the atmospheric column. At the heart of this was a carefully stacked Twin Otter and Egrett cloud sandwich with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 feet and the Egrett at 43,000 feet overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000 feet.",

The older versions of the NSRDB were modeled using cloud and weather information primarily collected at airports.

      "description": "The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2023. The NSRDB is updated annually and provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy programs, research, industry and the general public.\n\nThe NSRDB provides time-series data at 30-minute resolution of resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. Additionally time series data at 5 minutes for the US and 10 minutes for North, Central and South America at 2 km resolution are produced from the next generation of GOES satellites and made available from 2019. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI). The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to compute GHI and FARMS DNI is used to compute the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The PATMOS-X model uses radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of geostationary weather satellites. Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g., aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from NASA's Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to compute PV generation.",
