      "text": "Based on your request for XLS datasets of sea surface height anomalies in North America between 2010 and 2020, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the initial search results did not yield datasets that exactly match your specified format (XLS) and geographic location (North America) within the given timeframe. However, several relevant datasets were found that might be of interest to you, although they may require conversion or further processing to meet your specific needs.\n\n1. **NASA-SSH PDO Sea Surface Height Indicator**: This dataset, available from NASA, contains an indicator for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) based on satellite observations of sea surface height anomaly. While it's not exclusively focused on North America, it does cover the region and is available from 1993 to the present. The data is not in XLS format but can be downloaded in other formats and potentially converted.\n\n2. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: Provided by NASA as well, this dataset offers gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days, derived from various satellite missions. It covers the global ocean, including North America, from 1993 onwards. This dataset is also not in XLS format but is available for download and potential conversion.\n\n3. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**: This experimental dataset from NOAA provides global sea surface height anomalies derived from altimetry data. It's available from 2017 to the present and covers North America, although it's in a format that may require conversion or specific software to access.\n\nGiven the closest matches, it appears there might be a gap in datasets that exactly fit your criteria (XLS format, North America, 2010-2020). To proceed, you could consider the following options:\n\n- **Convert Dataset Format**: If you find a dataset that matches your criteria except for the file format, you might be able to convert it into XLS format using appropriate software or tools.\n\n- **Broaden Search Criteria**: Adjusting your search to include datasets outside of the XLS format or considering a slightly broader geographic area might yield more results.\n\n- **Contact Dataset Providers**: Reaching out to the providers of the closest matching datasets (e.g., NASA, NOAA) might provide insights into upcoming datasets, alternative formats, or guidance on how to access and convert existing data.\n\nIf you have any follow-up questions or need further assistance with searching or converting datasets, please don't hesitate to ask."

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction. More information on the SARAL mission can be found at: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/missions/current-missions/saral.html",
