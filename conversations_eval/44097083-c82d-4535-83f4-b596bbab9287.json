      "text": "Based on your request, I've conducted a search for XLSX datasets related to aerosol optical depth in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000. Although the exact parameters you're looking for are quite specific, I was able to find some relevant datasets that might be of interest to you.\n\n1. **NIMFR: Derived Total & Aerosol Optical Depth from 1st Michalsky Algorithm**: This dataset, available from the ARM Data Archive, provides aerosol optical depth data. While it doesn't specifically mention Antarctica or the exact time frame, it could be a useful resource for understanding aerosol optical depth. You can find more information at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::nimfraod1mich.\n\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths**: Another dataset from the ARM Data Archive, this resource offers data on aerosol optical depths, though again, it may not match your geographical and temporal criteria perfectly. The dataset can be explored further at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sashevisaod.\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001**: This dataset, available through Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FD0SO1YA0B9EY), contains monthly mean MODIS Level 3 data from aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. Although focused on High Mountain Asia, it includes aerosol optical depth and Angstrom exponent data from 2000 onwards, which might be useful for comparative studies or understanding broader trends.\n\n4. **Earth Observatory Aerosol Optical Depth**: This resource from NASA's Earth Observatory provides general information on aerosols, including their types, effects, and how aerosol optical depth is measured. While not a dataset per se, it's a valuable educational tool (http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_OD&eocn=home&eoci=globalmaps).\n\n5. **MODIS/Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT, MODIS/Terra+Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT, MODIS/Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**: These Near Real-Time (NRT) datasets from MODIS offer value-added aerosol optical depth products. They are designed for quantitative applications and are available through the LANCE-MODIS platform (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt). Though they may not directly match your criteria, they could be adapted or used for broader research purposes.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the datasets found exactly match your request for XLSX format and the specific geographical and temporal criteria. It's possible that such datasets exist but are not readily available through public datasets or require specific permissions to access.\n\nFor your next steps, I would recommend:\n- Contacting the dataset producers or research institutions directly to inquire about the availability of datasets matching your exact criteria.\n- Considering alternative formats or slightly broader criteria to maximize the usefulness of available datasets.\n- Utilizing data manipulation tools or programming libraries to convert or adapt existing datasets to better fit your needs.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any further assistance I can provide, such as helping with dataset conversion or locating similar resources."

Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
