      "text": "You are looking for datasets related to snow cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean, specifically between 2010 and 2020, in JSON format. \n\nAfter conducting a search based on your criteria, several datasets were identified that may be relevant to your query, although none directly mention the Atlantic Ocean as their primary focus area. Instead, these datasets provide information on snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere, which includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean. Here's a brief overview of what was found:\n\n1. **Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent, September 1980 Onward, Version 1**: This dataset provides weekly snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere from September 1980 onward at a 24 km resolution. While it covers a broader area than just the Atlantic Ocean, it could be useful for understanding snow cover trends over time, including any potential impacts on the Atlantic region. The data is available in NetCDF format, which may require conversion to JSON for your needs.\n\n2. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: This dataset offers monthly North American snow cover extent derived from weekly values, which might be helpful in studying seasonal fluctuations in snow cover that could indirectly affect the Atlantic Ocean region.\n\n3. **Reconstructed North American, Eurasian, and Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover Extent, 1915-1997, Version 1**: Although this dataset ends in 1997, it provides a long-term perspective on snow cover extent, including the Northern Hemisphere, which could be useful for historical context.\n\n4. **MEaSUREs Northern Hemisphere Terrestrial Snow Cover Extent Daily 25km EASE-Grid 2.0 V001**: This dataset provides daily snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere at a 25 km resolution, which could be helpful in analyzing detailed patterns of snow cover extent over the Atlantic Ocean region.\n\n5. **ISLSCP II Northern Hemisphere Monthly Snow Cover Extent**: This dataset provides the extent of snow on land at various scales, derived from satellite observations. It's a bit dated but offers a comprehensive view of snow cover extent over a long period.\n\nTo access these datasets, you can visit the following links:\n- Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent: https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10035/\n- Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html\n- Reconstructed North American, Eurasian, and Northern Hemisphere Snow Cover Extent, 1915-1997, Version 1: https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02131/\n- MEaSUREs Northern Hemisphere Terrestrial Snow Cover Extent Daily 25km EASE-Grid 2.0 V001: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FMEASURES%2FCRYOSPHERE%2Fnsidc-0530.001\n- ISLSCP II Northern Hemisphere Monthly Snow Cover Extent: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=snow_cover_xdeg_982&ac=true\n\nThese datasets might require conversion or processing to meet your specific needs, such as focusing on the Atlantic Ocean region or converting formats to JSON.\n\nIf none of these datasets directly meet your requirements, it might be helpful to clarify or refine your search criteria, such as specifying a particular region within the Atlantic Ocean or a more precise time frame within 2010-2020. Additionally, considering datasets that cover broader geographic areas but can be filtered or processed to focus on the Atlantic Ocean might be necessary."

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",

      "description": "This dataset provides estimates of maximum snow cover extent (SCE) and snow depth for each 8-day composite period from 2001 to 2017 at 1 km resolution across Alaska. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas covered by perennial ice/snow or open water. A downscaling scheme was used in which Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis 0.5 degree snow depth data were interpolated to a finer 1 km spatial grid.  In the methods used, the downscaling scheme incorporated MODIS SCE (MOD10A2) to better account for the influence of local topography on the 1km snow distribution patterns.  For MODIS cloud-contaminated pixels, persistent and patchy cloud cover conditions were improved by applying an elevation-based spatial filtering algorithm to predict snow occurrence.  Cloud-free MODIS SCE data were then used to downscale MERRA-2 snow depth data.  For each snow-covered 1 km pixel indicated by the MODIS data, the snow depth was estimated based on the snow depth of the neighboring MERRA-2 0.5 grid cell, with weights predicted using a spatial filter.",

The land cover classification maps feature between three and six classes common to mountainous regions and integral for accurate stereo snow depth mapping: illuminated snow, shaded snow, vegetation, exposed surfaces, surface water, and clouds. Also included are Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA map products. The source imagery for these data are the Maxar WorldView-2 and Maxar WorldView-3 Level-1B 8-band multispectral images, orthorectified and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. These Level-1B images are available under the NGA NextView/EnhancedView license.",
