      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of glacier mass balance in Europe between 1980 and 1990, I've searched through our database to find relevant datasets that match your criteria.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the retrieved datasets exactly match your specific request for glacier mass balance in Europe between 1980 and 1990 in CSV format. However, I can provide information on some related datasets that might be of interest to you:\n\n1. **Glacier Mass Balance and Regime Measurements and Analysis, 1945-2003**: This dataset includes annual mass balances, ablation, accumulation, and equilibrium-line altitude of mountain and subpolar glaciers outside the two major ice sheets, including some in Europe. Although it covers a broader time period than your request, it might still be useful for your research. You can find it at [https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10002/](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10002/).\n\n2. **USGS Benchmark Glacier Mass Balance and Project Data**: This dataset focuses on North American glaciers but provides a comprehensive approach to glacier mass balance analysis, which could be relevant for understanding methodologies applied to European glaciers. It's available at [https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/metadata/USGS.ASC74.xml](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/metadata/USGS.ASC74.xml).\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia 2 m DEM, Surface Velocity, and Lagrangian Surface Mass Balance for Select Debris Covered Glaciers**: Although this dataset is primarily focused on the High Mountain Asia region, it demonstrates the kind of detailed analysis that can be applied to glacier mass balance and might be of conceptual interest. Find it at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FDARPX4AR2OYO](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FDARPX4AR2OYO).\n\nTo better assist you, could you please provide more specific details about the glaciers or regions in Europe you're interested in? Additionally, are there any particular variables or parameters of glacier mass balance you're looking to include in your analysis? This information will help refine the search for more relevant datasets."

      "description": "This data release includes glacier wide mass balance solutions for Taku and Lemon Creek Glaciers, as well as the refined inputs used in these calculations. Input data are of three types: 1) time-variable area altitude distribution (AAD); 2) time series of point water balance at long term sites (with secondary sites given in recent years); 3) weather data from nearby stations, either installed along the glacier margins or taken from a nearby site if continuous glacier-adjacent data is unavailable. The USGS runs a coded analysis to transform the three input data types to the output glacier-wide data. Output data represent surface mass balance estimates. The output solution is a geodetically calibrated, conventional glacier-wide mass balance, which represents our preferred solution. Conventional glacier-wide mass balance from direct observations without calibration can be easily derived by using the geodetic calibration coefficients provided, if desired. We do not explicitly account for basal or englacial accumulation or ablation. Mass balances are reported in water equivalent (w.e.) units, and often represent integration of multiple field measurements. Whenever possible, we average multiple field measurements to account for surface roughness and measurement errors. Additional data for Lemon Creek Glacier, part of the Juneau Icefield, is available in a separate data release of USGS Benchmark Glacier mass balance data at https://doi.org/10.5066/F7HD7SRF  It is not included here to avoid duplication.\n      Preliminary mass balance estimates for the current calendar year are provided, but do not include direct measurements of ablation after the date of the fall visit.

      "description": "Natural attenuation of organic contaminants in groundwater can give rise to a series of complex biogeochemical reactions that release secondary contaminants to groundwater. In a crude oil contaminated aquifer, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons is coupled with the reduction of ferric iron (Fe(III)) hydroxides in aquifer sediments. As a result, naturally occurring arsenic (As), adsorbed to Fe(III) hydroxides in the aquifer sediment, is mobilized from sediment into groundwater. However, Fe(III) in sediment of other zones of the aquifer has the capacity to attenuate dissolved As via re-sorption. To better evaluate how long-term biodegradation coupled with Fe-reduction and As mobilization can redistribute As mass in contaminated aquifer, we quantified mass partitioning of Fe and As in the aquifer based on field observation data. Results show that Fe and As are spatially correlated in both groundwater and aquifer sediments. Mass partitioning calculations demonstrate that 99.9% of Fe and 99.5% of As are associated with aquifer sediment. The sediments act as both sources and sinks for As, depending on the redox conditions in the aquifer. Calculations reveal that at least 78% of the original As mass in sediment near the oil has been mobilized into groundwater over the 35-year lifespan of the plume. However, the calculations also show that only a small percentage of As mass (~0.5%) remains in groundwater, due to resorption onto sediment. At the leading edge of the plume, where groundwater is suboxic, sediments sequester Fe and As, causing As to accumulate to concentrations 5.6 times greater than background concentrations. However, current arsenic sinks can serve as future sources of arsenic as the plume evolves over time. The mass balance approach used in this study can is applicable to As cycling in other aquifers where groundwater As results from biodegradation of an organic carbon point source coupled with Fe reduction.",
