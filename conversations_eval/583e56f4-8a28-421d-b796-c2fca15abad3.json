      "text": "Based on your request, I've searched for datasets related to snow cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean between 2010 and 2020. Although snow cover is more commonly associated with land areas, I've found some relevant datasets that might interest you, particularly those that cover the northern parts of the Atlantic where sea ice and snow cover can be present.\n\nHere are a few datasets that could be relevant to your search, even though they might not perfectly match your criteria of focusing solely on the Atlantic Ocean:\n\n1. **Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent, September 1980 Onward, Version 1**: This dataset provides weekly snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere, including areas of the Atlantic Ocean where sea ice forms. It's available in NetCDF format, but you can potentially convert it to CSV for your analysis. The dataset covers the period from 1980 onward, so you can extract the data relevant to 2010-2020. [Access the dataset](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10035/).\n\n2. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: This dataset offers monthly North American snow cover extent derived from weekly values, which might be useful for understanding broader patterns that could influence or be related to conditions in the Atlantic. [Visit the dataset page](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html).\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Northern Hemisphere Terrestrial Snow Cover Extent Daily 25km EASE-Grid 2.0 V001**: Part of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program, this dataset provides daily Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent at a 25 km resolution. While focused on land, it could offer insights into large-scale snow cover patterns that might indirectly relate to Atlantic Ocean conditions. [Explore the dataset](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FMEASURES%2FCRYOSPHERE%2Fnsidc-0530.001).\n\n4. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent, Version 4**: This dataset combines snow cover and sea ice extent at weekly intervals from 1966 through January 2023, making it a comprehensive resource for understanding seasonal fluctuations in snow and ice cover across the Northern Hemisphere, including the North Atlantic. [Download the dataset](https://daacdata.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/nsidc0046_weekly_snow_seaice/).\n\nTo refine your search or find datasets more closely matching your needs, you might consider specifying a particular region within the Atlantic Ocean (e.g., the North Atlantic) or looking into datasets that explicitly cover sea ice extent, as these might be more directly relevant to your query about snow cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIf these suggestions do not fully meet your requirements or if you're looking for something more specific, please let me know how I can further assist you. Your feedback will help refine the search to match your needs more accurately."

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",

      "description": "This dataset provides estimates of maximum snow cover extent (SCE) and snow depth for each 8-day composite period from 2001 to 2017 at 1 km resolution across Alaska. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas covered by perennial ice/snow or open water. A downscaling scheme was used in which Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis 0.5 degree snow depth data were interpolated to a finer 1 km spatial grid.  In the methods used, the downscaling scheme incorporated MODIS SCE (MOD10A2) to better account for the influence of local topography on the 1km snow distribution patterns.  For MODIS cloud-contaminated pixels, persistent and patchy cloud cover conditions were improved by applying an elevation-based spatial filtering algorithm to predict snow occurrence.  Cloud-free MODIS SCE data were then used to downscale MERRA-2 snow depth data.  For each snow-covered 1 km pixel indicated by the MODIS data, the snow depth was estimated based on the snow depth of the neighboring MERRA-2 0.5 grid cell, with weights predicted using a spatial filter.",

The land cover classification maps feature between three and six classes common to mountainous regions and integral for accurate stereo snow depth mapping: illuminated snow, shaded snow, vegetation, exposed surfaces, surface water, and clouds. Also included are Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA map products. The source imagery for these data are the Maxar WorldView-2 and Maxar WorldView-3 Level-1B 8-band multispectral images, orthorectified and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. These Level-1B images are available under the NGA NextView/EnhancedView license.",
