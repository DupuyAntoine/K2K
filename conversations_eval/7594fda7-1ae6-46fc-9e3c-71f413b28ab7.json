While I couldn't find exact matches, I've retrieved some relevant datasets that might interest you:\n\n1. **CMS: Estimated Deforested Area Biomass, Tropical America, Africa, and Asia, 2000**: This dataset provides estimates of pre-deforestation aboveground live woody biomass at 30-m resolution for deforested areas of tropical America, tropical Africa, and tropical Asia for the year 2000. Although it's not exclusively focused on South America, it does cover parts of the region. You can find it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=CMS_Pantropical_Forest_Biomass_1337&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=CMS_Pantropical_Forest_Biomass_1337&ac=true).\n2. **LBA-ECO LC-22 Field Validation of MODIS Deforestation Detection, Brazil, 2003-2004**: This dataset contains field observations, corresponding GPS points, and point and polygons of deforested areas in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, for the period August 2003 to July 2004. It's not a perfect match, but it does provide insights into deforestation in a specific region of South America. You can access it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=LC22_MODIS_Field_Val_2004_1262&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=LC22_MODIS_Field_Val_2004_1262&ac=true).\n3. **LBA-ECO LC-14 Modeled Deforestation Scenarios, Amazon Basin: 2002-2050**: This dataset provides the results of modeled scenarios for future patterns of deforestation across the Amazon Basin from 2002 to 2050. While it's not limited to the 2000-2010 time frame, it does offer a broader perspective on deforestation trends in the region.

However, I couldn't find any datasets that exactly match your request for GEOJSON format and the specific time frame.\n\nIf you're willing to consider alternative formats or adjust your search parameters, I'd be happy to try and assist you further. Please let me know if there's any additional information you can provide or if you'd like me to suggest next steps."

The Global Forest Change data set defines trees as all vegetation taller than 5m in height. Forest loss (deforestation) is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. The data on forest loss were aggregated to a one kilometer resolution and subsetted to 200 kilometers from the coast to produce this data set. Raster values represent the percentage of the grid cell area that experienced forest cover loss from 2000 to 2012.",

At greater distances from the new roads the evidence is mixed, including negative coefficients of inconsistent significance between 100 and 300km, and if anything, higher neighbor deforestation at distances over 300 km.",

This larger defined Amazon Basin (PanAmazon area) includes the Amazon River watershed, the Legal Amazon in Brazil, and the Guiana region. The model SimAmazonia was used to simulate monthly deforestation in the Amazon Basin from 2002 to 2050 for two scenarios: (1) a \"Business-as-Usual\" scenario, which considered the deforestation trends across the basin and projected the rates by using historical images and their variations from 1997 to 2002 and then added to that the effect of paving a set of major roads, and (2) a \"Governance\" scenario, that also considered the current deforestation trends, but assumed a 50% limit  imposed for deforested land within each basin's subregion, and that existing and proposed Protected Areas (PAs), play a decisive role in limiting deforestation as well (Soares et al., 2006).The provided data products include one GeoTiff (*.tif) for each year (2002 to 2050) for both model scenarios for a total of 98 files.

Data are provided in ESRI shapefile format. There are five compressed (*.zip) data files with this data set. Each shapefile represents one year of post-deforestation land use. Land use in the years following deforestation was estimated using annual time series of MODIS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index). Metrics of vegetation phenology derived annual time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI data were analyzed using a decision-tree classifier to characterize the major cover type in each area of new deforestation. Post-deforestation land use for each large deforestation event was classified based on the classification of MODIS phenology metrics for all years following deforestation during 2002-2005.",

The model, DEforestation CArbon Flux (DECAF), was used to provide annual carbon fluxes from large deforestation events (>25 ha) based on post-deforestation land use, and the frequency and duration of active fires during the deforestation process. Carbon fluxes associated with the conversion of Cerrado to mechanized crop production, fires in Cerrado, and managed pasture cover types were also estimated.

      "description": "This data set provides estimates of watershed deforestation, as a proportion of the total area of watersheds, in Rondonia, Brazil for 1999. Deforestation maps were determined for the main agricultural and surrounding forested areas of Rondonia using multiple Landsat TM scenes (Biggs et al. 2008). Cumulative deforestation estimates were derived from this time series of Landsat scenes from 1975 to 1999. To obtain watershed-level estimates of deforestation, watershed boundaries and stream networks were delineated by a flow accumulation algorithm using a 90-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results were watersheds of seven Strahler stream orders (1-7) with stream networks that closely matched those of the 1:100,000 topographic maps for the area. The watershed boundaries, classified by stream order, were overlain on the time series of deforestation maps to determine the cumulative deforestation extent in 1999. This data set contains six ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles of the watershed boundaries for streams orders 2-7, the smallest watershed (second order) to the largest inclusive watershed (seventh order). The cumulative deforestation estimates, as a proportion of total area for each watershed, are available as a comma-delimited text file that can be related to the individual watershed boundary shapefiles. Cumulative deforestation data are available for first order streams, although not as a shapefile. There are six zipped ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles (*.zip) and one ASCII comma separated file with this data set.",
