      "text": "Based on your request for XLS datasets of earthquake events in the Arctic between 1980 and 1990, I've conducted a search to find relevant datasets for you. Unfortunately, the initial search did not yield exact matches that fit all your criteria, particularly for the specified time frame and format. However, I can guide you on the next steps and provide information on related datasets that might be useful.\n\n### Summary of Your Request:\n- **Theme/Topic:** Earthquake events\n- **Spatial Coverage:** Arctic\n- **Temporal Coverage:** 1980-1990\n- **Variable(s):** Earthquake data\n- **Format:** XLS\n- **Producer:** Not specified\n- **Dataset/Source:** Not specified\n\n### Datasets Considered:\nWhile the exact criteria you specified did not match any datasets directly, several datasets related to earthquake events were found. These include:\n\n1. **Event deposit characteristics from percussion driven gravity cores collected in Alaskan lakes and fjords following the 2018 Anchorage earthquake** - Although this dataset is outside your specified time frame, it's an example of earthquake-related data that could be relevant for understanding seismic activity in the Arctic region.\n2. **Utah FORGE: Earthquake Information and Data** - This resource provides access to earthquake data but is not specifically focused on the Arctic region or the 1980-1990 time frame.\n3. **Comprehensive Global Database of Earthquake-Induced Landslide Events and their Impacts** - This database is a global inventory of earthquake-induced landslides and includes information on earthquake size, depth, and impacts, which could be useful for broader research on seismic hazards.\n\n### Next Steps:\nGiven the lack of direct matches, I recommend considering the following steps:\n\n- **Broaden Your Search Criteria:** If possible, expanding your search to include a broader time frame or considering other formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) might yield more results.\n- **Specific Producer or Dataset:** Identifying a specific producer or dataset related to Arctic earthquake events could refine the search.\n- **Alternative Sources:** Looking into scientific publications, research papers, or governmental reports from the time period might provide the necessary data, even if not in the exact format requested.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or would like to refine your search based on the information provided, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

      "description": "The 1988 Spitak Earthquake database is an extensive collection of geophysical and geological data, maps, charts, images and descriptive text pertaining to the catastrophic earthquake in Armenia. This earthquake was unique both in catastrophic effects and in study coverage. Research groups from the former U.S.S.R., U.S.A., France, and Japan studied the earthquake area. The database was developed as a cooperative effort between centers in Russia and the United States. The goal was to provide seismologists around the world with a complete set of data for the devastating earthquake. The database contains practically all material relevant to the 1988 Spitak earthquake and its aftereffects. It also includes the geological and geophysical information collected during the years prior to the event, important for understanding the event. Almost 2,000 files and 170 megabytes of data are contained in the collection. The database is static and is no longer being updated.",

Care should be taken when comparing with other inventories because different authors use different mapping techniques. This inventory also could be associated with other earthquakes such as aftershocks or triggered events. Please check the author methods summary and the original data source for more information on these details and to confirm the viability of this inventory for your specific use.   With the exception of the data from USGS sources, the inventory data and associated metadata were not acquired by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and thus have not been reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the USGS.  They are presented as part of this data series for convenience of the user only, as part of an effort to make published ground-failure inventories more accessible from a single aggregated site.

Point cloud data produced from 13 stereo data sets of 0.5 m resolution, panchromatic Pleiades images acquired by Airbus (funded by NERC, UK). The images were processed using the LPS module of the ERDAS Imagine 2013 software (version 13.00.00, Build 281). A pixel-by-pixel matching procedure was implemented with a window size of 5-by-5 pixels and a correlation coefficient of 0.3 to 0.7.     For further details see: Zhou, Y., J. R. Elliott, B. Parsons, and R. T. Walker (2015), The 2013 Balochistan earthquake: An extraordinary or completely ordinary event?, Geophysical Research Letters, 43(7), 3134-3142, doi:10.1002/2015GL065096",

      "description": "Currently, there are many datasets describing landslides caused by individual earthquakes, and global inventories of earthquake-induced landslides (EQIL). However, until recently, there were no datasets that provide a comprehensive description of the impacts of earthquake-induced landslide events. In this data release, we present an up-to-date, comprehensive global database containing all literature-documented earthquake-induced landslide events for the 249-year period from 1772 through August 2021. The database represents an update of the catalog developed by Seal et al. (2020), which summarized events through March 2020 and was based on the catalog developed by Nowicki Jessee et al. (2020). The revised catalog contains 281 historical earthquakes, 162 of which include documented landslide fatality counts. This represents an addition of 17 earthquakes since the previous version, 9 with documented landslide fatalities, and a removal of 2 duplicate entries. The database includes (where available) information on earthquake size (moment magnitude (Mw), surface-wave magnitude (Ms), and body-wave magnitude (mb)), depth, earthquake fault type, date and time, location, the availability of a ShakeMap, which estimates the spatial distribution of ground shaking from the USGS ShakeMap system (Worden and Wald, 2016), the availability of a geospatial landslide inventory, information about landslide occurrence (number of landslides, area or volume of landsliding, area affected by landsliding, landslide magnitude), earthquake/landslide impact (total fatalities, landslide fatalities, and number of injuries due to the effects of the earthquake), and USGS Ground Failure Tool estimates (estimated area and population exposed to landsliding). The full dataset of all known landslide-triggering events is provided as “EQIL Database 2022.csv,” including information on the data source(s) for each data component. A subset of the dataset, showing only those events for which landslide fatality counts are available, is provided as “EQIL Database LSFatality 2022.csv.” This subset only includes those columns from \"EQIL Database 2022.csv\" which are necessary for landslide fatality data analysis and omits columns such as source columns and secondary values.",
