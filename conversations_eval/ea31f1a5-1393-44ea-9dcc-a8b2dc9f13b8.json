      "text": "You are looking for CSV datasets related to river discharge in Europe, specifically for the period between 2015 and 2023. After conducting a search, several datasets were found that may match your criteria, although some might not perfectly fit the temporal or spatial scope you're interested in.\n\n1. **Global River Discharge Dataset (RivDIS)**: This dataset, available from NASA's Earthdata portal, contains monthly averaged discharge measurements for over 1,018 stations worldwide, including Europe, from 1807 to 1991. While it doesn't exactly match your 2015-2023 timeframe, it's a comprehensive global dataset that could be useful for broader analysis or comparison.\n\n2. **SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: Although primarily focused on southern Africa, this dataset is part of a larger compilation of monthly mean discharge data for over 2600 sites worldwide. It might include some European river discharge data, but the primary focus is not on Europe.\n\n3. **LBA Regional River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: Similar to the SAFARI 2000 dataset, this compilation focuses on the Amazonia region in South America. It's part of a global river discharge data set but is not specifically tailored to European rivers.\n\n4. **SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products Version 1**: This dataset provides estimates of river discharge derived from the SWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) mission. It includes both unconstrained and gauge-constrained estimates. While it's a valuable resource for river discharge data, its focus and availability might not perfectly align with your specific needs for European rivers between 2015 and 2023.\n\n5. **River Discharge Dataset for Selected Locations on Diversions from the Blitzen River**: This dataset contains instantaneous measurements of discharge for specific locations in the United States, not Europe. However, it's an example of the type of detailed discharge data that might be available for other rivers, including those in Europe.\n\n6. **Indian River (Sitka, Alaska) stage and discharge from 2007-2016**: Another U.S.-based dataset, it provides detailed river stage, water temperature, and discharge measurements. Again, not specific to Europe but indicative of the data that could be available for similar studies in European contexts.\n\n7. **Boat-based river bathymetry and stream velocity on the upper Willamette River, Oregon, Spring 2015**: This dataset focuses on bathymetry and stream velocity measurements for a river in the United States. While not directly applicable to your search, it demonstrates the kind of hydrological data that might be available for European rivers.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these datasets precisely matches your request for European river discharge data in CSV format for the years 2015-2023. The search results suggest a need for more specific or possibly more contemporary datasets focused on European rivers.\n\nTo refine your search, it might be helpful to specify:\n- A particular European country or region.\n- A specific river or river basin.\n- The desired temporal resolution (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).\n- Any quality or validation criteria for the datasets.\n\nAdditionally, exploring databases from European environmental agencies, such as the European Environment Agency (EEA), or national hydrological services might yield more targeted results."

The SWOT mission is implemented jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.Sword of Science data products are generated from the open-source SWOT Confluence program and contain river discharge parameter estimates as well as discharge time series for both river reaches and river nodes, following the SWOT River Database (SWORD) structure. Granules from both constrained and unconstrained branches are composed of prior information (e.g., mean annual flow predicted by global hydrological models) and the resulting discharge estimates. Priors and results files for both constrained and unconstrained branches are available in netCDF format. Users are encouraged to reference the SWOT Confluence documentation and notebook tutorials for full documentation of the data structure and variables available.Development of the SWOT Confluence program as well as the Sword of Science data products was funded by NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program.",

      "description": "This data set is a subset of a global river discharge data set by Coe and Olejniczak (1999). The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10° N to 25° S, 30° to 85° W).The global river discharge data set (Coe and Olejniczak 1999), formerly known as the \"Climate, People, and Environment Program (CPEP) Global River Discharge Database,\" is a compilation of monthly mean discharge data for more than 2600 sites worldwide. The data were compiled from RivDIS Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy. The period of record for the sites varies from 3 years to greater than 100.The purpose of the global compilation is to provide detailed hydrographic information for the climate research community in as general a format as possible.

NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.
