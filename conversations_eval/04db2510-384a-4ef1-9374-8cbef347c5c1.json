      "text": "I've searched for NETCDF datasets related to sea level rise on a global scale between 2015 and 2023. Unfortunately, the provided dataset search results don't directly match your request for global sea level rise data in NETCDF format for the specified time period.\n\nHowever, I can offer some insights and suggestions based on the available information:\n\n1. **Understanding Sea Level Rise**: Sea level rise is a critical indicator of climate change, influenced by factors such as thermal expansion of seawater, melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and changes in land water storage. Global datasets typically cover these aspects to provide a comprehensive view of sea level changes.\n\n2. **Available Datasets**: While the search results didn't yield exact matches, there are datasets related to sea level rise, although they might not be in NETCDF format or might not cover the exact time frame you specified. For example:\n   - **NOAA Office for Coastal Management Sea Level Rise Data**: This dataset provides information on potential sea level rise inundation extent, though it might not directly match your request for NETCDF format or global coverage.\n   - Other datasets found relate more to regional impacts of sea level rise, such as those affecting New York City or the San Francisco Bay area, rather than global data.\n\n3. **Suggestions for Next Steps**:\n   - **Check with Data Providers**: You might want to directly check the websites of major data providers like NOAA, NASA, or the European Space Agency (ESA) for datasets that match your criteria more closely. These organizations often have extensive datasets related to climate change and sea level rise.\n   - **Alternative Formats**: Consider whether datasets in other formats (like CSV or HDF5) could be useful or if there are tools available to convert these into NETCDF.\n   - **Specify Requirements**: If you have specific requirements for data resolution, spatial coverage, or particular variables related to sea level rise, mentioning these could help narrow down the search.\n\nGiven the importance of sea level rise data for understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change, I recommend exploring the aforementioned sources and considering broader search parameters if possible. If you have any further questions or need assistance with accessing specific types of data, feel free to ask."

      "description": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nThese data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.5 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions in half foot increments. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).\n\nThe model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.\n\nBoth raster and vector data are provided for each sea level rise amount above MHHW. The raster data represent both the horizontal extent of inundation and depth above ground, in meters. The vector data represent the horizontal extent of both hydrologically connected and unconnected inundation. The vector \"slr\" data represent inundation that is hydrologically connected to the ocean. The vector \"low\" data represent areas that are hydrologically unconnected to the ocean, but are below the sea level rise amount and may also flood.\n\nFor more information, contact coastal.info@noaa.gov.",
