      "text": "Based on your search for lake surface area in the Arctic between 1980 and 1990, I have found several datasets that may be of interest to you. However, I must note that the specific time frame of 1980 to 1990 is quite narrow, and datasets from this period may be limited. Despite this, I've managed to identify a few relevant datasets:\n\n1. **Timeseries of Arctic-Boreal Lake Area Derived from CubeSat Imagery, 2017**: Although this dataset is from 2017 and doesn't exactly match your time frame, it provides near-daily lake area timeseries for 85,358 lakes across four study areas in Northern Canada and Alaska. The data is in JSON format and can be accessed through the NASA Earthdata portal.\n\n2. **Summary data from Arctic Network water surface area monitoring**: This dataset, available from the National Park Service's IRMA portal, contains summary data derived from Landsat images to monitor water surface area in Alaska's Arctic National Parks, including data from the 1980s and 1990s, although it might not be specifically formatted in JSON.\n\n3. **Lakes Bathymetry in Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, Alaska**: This dataset includes bathymetric data and digitized polygon lake perimeters for several lakes within the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. While it doesn't directly provide lake surface area measurements for the specified time frame, it offers valuable spatial data that could be used in conjunction with other datasets to estimate surface areas.\n\nFor more precise and directly relevant data, I recommend exploring the following options:\n- **NASA's Earthdata Portal**: Offers a wide range of datasets related to Arctic lakes, including some historical data that might cover the 1980-1990 period.\n- **NOAA's Data Catalog**: Provides access to various datasets, including those related to lake surface areas and Arctic climate conditions.\n- **Academic Research Databases**: Searching through scientific literature and research databases like Google Scholar or specific journal databases can yield studies and datasets focused on Arctic lake surface areas during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nTo narrow down your search or find more specific datasets, I would need more details, such as:\n- Specific lakes or regions within the Arctic you're interested in.\n- Any particular units of measurement for lake surface area (e.g., square kilometers, square miles).\n- Data quality or accuracy requirements.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to refine your search based on these parameters or if there's anything else I can assist you with."

These lake area estimates were produced using digital images from newly developed Planet Labs CubeSats, small satellites with a 4-band (blue, green, red, near-infrared) camera payload. In constellation, CubeSats collected imagery at very high spatial (3-5m) and temporal (near-daily) resolution. From the imagery, each lake's mean, minimum, and maximum areas and seasonal dynamism were derived. The dataset covers four Arctic-Boreal regions: the Yukon Flats Basin (YFB) in eastern interior Alaska, and the Mackenzie River Valley (MRV), Canadian Shield Transect (CST), and Hudson Bay Lowland (HBL) in Canada.",

      "description": "The chemical composition of lakes is an important ecosystem property that can have considerable influence on aquatic ecosystem structure and function. Since lake chemistry is sensitive to climate and disturbance, lakes may serve as a sentinel of current and projected [SDM1] climate change through long-term monitoring. Here, we report findings from a two-year pilot study aimed at characterizing the chemical composition of large lakes in National Park Service lands of the Arctic Inventory and Monitoring Network (ARCN). We collected water samples from 20 large lakes in Bering Land Bridge National Preserve (BELA), Gates of the Arctic National Park (GAAR), and Noatak National Preserve (NOAT) during the 2013 and 2014 field seasons (between June and September). Water samples were analyzed for dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, nutrient concentrations, major cations and anions, and water stable isotopes. We also collected field measurements of lake surface temperature and temperature profiles, specific conductivity, and pH. We observed considerable variation in the chemical composition of large lakes with ARCN parks. For instance, DOC concentrations ranged from 1 to 12 mgC L-1 across all lakes, and DOM aromaticity was highly variable, as indicated by measurements of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA254). Nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus species) were generally low, indicating oligotrophic conditions and likely strong nutrient-limitation of primary production. Cation and anion concentrations varied across lakes, reflecting spatial variations in lithology. Overall, large lakes appear to be unimpaired with respect to a broad suite of water quality parameters. However, Arctic lakes are likely vulnerable to climate-driven changes hydrology and landscape disturbance (e.g. wildfire and permafrost thaw). Future monitoring of large lakes ARCN should be designed to detect chemical and hydrologic properties across space and time, both as a means of assessing these vulnerabilities and for improving watershed management activities.",

      "description": "Clear Lake is a 180 km2 freshwater lake located approximately 120 km northwest of Sacramento in the California Coast Range. The lake is a popular sport-fishing destination, however, there are fish consumption advisories associated with mercury (Hg) contamination for several species. The lake has three arms: a large open-water region to the northwest (Upper Arm), a smaller and narrower region to the southeast (Lower Arm), and the smallest and narrowest region to the east (Oaks Arm). The Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), located on the eastern shore of the Oaks Arm, was mined by underground methods starting in the 1870s and then open-pit methods during the 1920s to 1950s. Since 1992, the SBMM has been a Superfund site managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This former Hg mining area is thought to be the dominant contributor of Hg to Clear Lake and is the focus of continued remediation to minimize Hg impacts to Clear Lake. The SBMM area is an active geothermal area with springs and gas fumaroles. \nClear Lake is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, based on elevated concentrations of nutrients (various forms of nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) that cause excessive algal blooms and periodic fish kills. There are current studies underway (by the University of California, Davis, UCD) to improve the understanding of nutrient cycling within the lake. The UCD group is developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic computer model (https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Blue-Ribbon-Committee-for-the-Rehabilitation-of-Clear-Lake/2022-BRC-Annual-Report-_20230110_DraftFinal.pdf ) of the lake that simulates periodic stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as nutrient dynamics. An effort is planned during 2023-2025 to add mercury cycling to the 3-D model. Monitoring and modeling efforts are being implemented to improve understanding of the ways that nutrient dynamics affect the cycling, transport and bioaccumulation of Hg, which remains poorly understood. \nThis data release documents the results of water-quality sampling during June 2020 through June 2022. It includes three data tables given as machine readable 'comma-separated values' format (*.csv):  1) ‘T1_CL_DataDictionary’, the Data Dictionary, which provides definitions and details related to the other two data tables and includes citations of analytical methods; 2) ‘T2_CL_Discrete_SW’, the discrete-sample surface-water dataset including concentration data for Hg species (including total mercury and methylmercury in dissolved and particulate forms) and nutrients (including several forms of N and P); and 3) ‘T3_CL_QA_SW’, a quality assurance data summary for the discrete water samples. In addition, file ‘Clear Lake Coordinates_SW 2020-22_052324’ provides the sampling locations in a machine-readable geospatial file format (*.kmz).",

      "description": "In 2005 the National Park Service funded an expedition to characterize the freshwater resources in the northernmost National Parklands in Alaska (Bowden et al., 2005). The primary purpose of this project was to extend the limited base of data and knowledge about the freshwater resources of the Gates of the Arctic Park and Preserve and the Noatak National Preserve. This initiative is part of the National Park Service’s (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring program (Lawler et al., 2009). The 2005 field initiative included landscape and freshwater ecosystem experts from the University of Vermont, the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, the University of Alabama, Utah State University, and the Marine Biological Laboratory. Substantial assistance in preparation and execution of the field work was provided by staff from the NPS Arctic Parks Network (ARCN) in Fairbanks. The study area for the 2005 effort focused on a portion of the Noatak River from 12-Mile Creek to Lake Matcharak in the western region of the Gates of the Arctic Park and Preserve. The team was deployed 13 July, 2005 and operated continuously in the field until taken out on 26 July 2005. Over the course of the two week field period a total of 20 different stream reaches and 11 lakes were assessed. This data release publishes the bathymetric data and digitized polygon lake perimeters for the following lakes: Big Guy Lake, Kipmik Lake, Lake Ermi, Lake Gigi, Lake Pjolene, Matcharak Lake, Omelaktavik Lake, Skeeter Lake, Unknown-1, Unknown-2, Unknown-4,\n\nKey words: Lake, Alaska, Bathymetry, Arctic, Pond, Big Guy Lake, Kipmik Lake, Lake Ermi, Lake Gigi, Lake Pjolene, Matcharak Lake, Omelaktavik Lake, Skeeter Lake, Unknown-1, Unknown-2, Unknown-4\n\nBathymetric Data\nDetailed bathymetric surveys were conducted using a GPS-linked, Garmin-153C echosounder attached to an inflatable kayak which was paddled across lakes along specified transect lines.
