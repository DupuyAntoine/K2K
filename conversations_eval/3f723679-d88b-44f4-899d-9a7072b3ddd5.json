      "text": "I've searched for datasets matching your request for sea surface height anomalies in North America between 2010 and 2020 in CSV format. While I couldn't find an exact match, I've identified several relevant datasets that might interest you:\n\n1. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: This dataset provides gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) above a mean sea surface, on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days. It contains the fully corrected heights, with a delay of up to 3 months. Although it's not specific to North America, it covers the region and the time period you're interested in. You can find more information and access the data at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\n2. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**: This dataset offers sea surface height anomalies from altimetry, although it starts from 2017, which is slightly later than your requested time frame. It's available in various formats, but you might need to convert it to CSV. You can explore this dataset at [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html).\n\n3. **ATLAS/ICESat-2 L3B Daily and Monthly Gridded Polar Sea Surface Height Anomaly V003**: This dataset contains daily and monthly gridded polar sea surface height anomalies. Although it focuses on polar regions, it might be useful if your area of interest extends into these areas. The dataset is available at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FATLAS%2FATL21.003](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FATLAS%2FATL21.003).\n\nTo refine your search, could you please provide more details about the producer or specific dataset/source you're looking for? Additionally, are you open to exploring datasets that might require conversion to CSV or those that cover a slightly broader geographical area?"

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction. More information on the SARAL mission can be found at: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/missions/current-missions/saral.html",
