      "text": "You're looking for JSON datasets of vegetation indices in the Atlantic Ocean, covering the period between 2010 and 2020. I've searched through our available datasets and found a few that might be relevant to your query.\n\nAlthough I couldn't find datasets specifically focused on the Atlantic Ocean, I did find some global datasets that include vegetation indices and might be useful for your research. These datasets often cover large areas, including oceans, and provide valuable information on vegetation health and trends.\n\nHere are a few datasets that could be of interest:\n1. **VIIRS/NPP Vegetation Indices 8-Day L3 Global 500m SIN Grid**: This dataset provides vegetation indices, including NDVI and EVI, at a 500-meter resolution. It's available from 2012 onwards and could be relevant for studying vegetation trends in coastal areas of the Atlantic Ocean.\n2. **Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) Vegetation Indices**: This collection includes various datasets with different temporal resolutions (daily, 7-day, 15-day, monthly) and covers a long period, from 1981 to 2014. While not specifically focused on the Atlantic, these datasets offer a broad view of global vegetation indices.\n3. **HLS Operational Land Imager Vegetation Indices Daily Global 30 m V2.0**: This dataset offers high-resolution (30 meters) vegetation indices, including NDVI, EVI, and others, derived from Landsat 8 and 9 data. It's more focused on land areas but could be useful for coastal zones and islands within the Atlantic.\n\nTo refine your search or access these datasets, I recommend visiting the NASA Earthdata portal (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) or similar data repositories, where you can find more detailed information and download links for these and other relevant datasets.\n\nIf you're looking for something more specific to the Atlantic Ocean, could you please provide more details or clarify your requirements? This would help me narrow down the search and possibly find more targeted datasets for you."

      "description": "This dataset contains spatially-referenced tabular data associated with a study to characterize vegetation conditions within a dry mixed conifer forest study area (the Gearhart Mountain Wilderness) in southern Oregon, USA, in 2001 (a single year drought without any widespread insect mortality) and 2009 (during a multi-year drought that coincided with a severe outbreak of mountain pine beetle; MPB). Specifically, this study identified refugia from the effects of droughts (in 2001 and in 2009) and interacting drought-MPB effects (in 2009). In this study, refugia were defined as local areas that were relatively buffered against detrimental ecological effects from drought and MPB-attack. Refugia were quantified using remotely-sensed Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) from the Landsat archive across a 30-m resolution grid. This dataset contains the identified refugia in each year (2001 and 2009) along with landscape characteristics (topographic, soil, and forest stand characteristics) that were used as explanatory variables to model the locations of refugia.\nReferences: \nCartwright, 2018, &lt;placeholder cite for paper in preparation, bibliographic info will be filled in when available.&gt;",

Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes including primary production and land cover conversion.Note: This is a near real-time product only. Standard historical data and imagery for VNP13A4N (8-Day 500m) are not available. The only 500m standard Vegetation Indices product available is a 16-Day composite (VNP13A1). So, users can either use VNP13A1, use the NDVI standard products from LAADS web (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/), or access the science quality VNP09A1 data and create the VI product of their own.",

A decision tree classifier was trained using field observations and Landsat TM data of land cover from 2003-2004 to identify seven land-cover classes. The classifier was applied to the 2000-2001 and 2003-2004 MODIS ENVI and EVI data. There are two GeoTIFF (.tif) files with this data set.",

      "description": "This dataset contains half-hourly ground solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and vegetation indices including NDVI, EVI, Red edge chlorophyll index, green chlorophyll index, and photochemical reflectance index at seven crop sites in Nebraska and Illinois for the period 2016-2021. Four sites were located at Eddy Covariance (EC) tower sites (sites US-Ne2, US-Ne3, US-UiB, and US-UiC), and three sites were located on private farms (sites Reifsteck, Rund, and Reinhart). The sites were either miscanthus, corn-soybean rotation or corn-corn-soybean rotation. The spectral data for SIF retrieval and hyperspectral reflectance for vegetation index calculation were collected by the FluoSpec2 system, installed near planting, and uninstalled after harvest to collect whole growing-season data. Raw nadir SIF at 760 nm from different algorithms (sFLD, 3FLD, iFLD, SFM) are included. SFM_nonlinear and SFM_linear represent the Spectral fitting method (SFM) with the assumption that fluorescence and reflectance change with wavelength non-linearly and linearly, respectively. Additional data include two SIF correction factors including calibration coefficient adjustment factor (f_cal_corr_QEPRO) and upscaling nadir SIF to eddy covariance footprint factor (ratio_EC footprint, SIF pixel), and measured FPAR from quantum sensors and Rededge NDVI calculated FPAR. The data are provided in comma-separated values (CSV) format.",

The combined measurement enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLSL30 Vegetation Indices (HLSL30_VI) product is derived from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 OLI data products. Vegetation indices combine specific bands of satellite data to quantify various aspects of vegetation. Analysis of vegetation indices allows for tracking changes in vegetation over time, identifying areas of stress or deforestation, and assessing crop health. Vegetation indices provide a reliable and efficient means of understanding the complex dynamics of vegetation health. The HLSS30_VI and HLSL30_VI products are gridded to the same resolution and Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/)) tiling system and thus are “stackable” for time series analysis.The HLSL30_VI product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each variable is distributed as a separate file. Nine indicators of vegetation health are included in the HLSL30_VI product: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2), and Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI). See the User Guide for a more detailed description of the individual vegetation health variables provided in the HLSL30_VI product.",
