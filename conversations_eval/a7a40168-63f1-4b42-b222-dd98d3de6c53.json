      "text": "I've conducted a search for datasets related to CO2 atmospheric concentration over Europe for the period of 2010-2022. Although the initial search criteria focused on a specific geographic and temporal range, the retrieved datasets cover various aspects of atmospheric gas concentrations, including CO2, but may not perfectly match the requested spatial and temporal criteria.\n\nThe search results include several datasets from the Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) and other projects. While these datasets primarily focus on Arctic regions, they provide valuable information on atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which could be relevant for understanding global carbon cycling patterns.\n\nHere are some of the datasets that were found:\n\n1. **CARVE: Monthly Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations (2009-2013) and Modeled Fluxes, Alaska**: This dataset contains monthly averages of atmospheric CO2 concentration from satellite and airborne observations between 2009 and 2013. Although it's focused on Alaska, it could be useful for comparative studies or understanding Northern Hemisphere carbon dynamics.\n2. **ACT-America: L2 In Situ Atmospheric CO2, CO, CH4, and O3 Concentrations, Eastern USA**: This dataset includes atmospheric CO2 concentrations collected during airborne campaigns in the eastern United States from 2016 to 2019. It might not directly address European CO2 concentrations but could provide insights into atmospheric carbon dynamics in another Northern Hemisphere region.\n3. **ISLSCP II Globalview: Atmospheric CO2 Concentrations**: This dataset offers synchronized and smoothed time series of atmospheric CO2 concentrations at selected sites worldwide, including some European locations, from 1979 to 2001. It's a valuable resource for long-term trend analysis, although it doesn't cover the exact period requested.\n\nTo find datasets that more precisely match your request for CO2 atmospheric concentration over Europe from 2010 to 2022, additional search criteria or alternative datasets might be necessary. Some possible next steps could include:\n\n- Checking with European environmental agencies or research institutions for more targeted datasets.\n- Exploring global atmospheric models that might include European CO2 concentration data for the specified period.\n- Considering satellite data, such as from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) series, which might offer global CO2 concentration measurements, including over Europe.\n\nIf you have any more specific details about the desired dataset (e.g., preferred format, specific European countries of interest), I could attempt a more tailored search."

Atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements were obtained from Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE) and NOAA Arctic Coast Guard (ACG) flights, the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT), and NOAA/ESRL vertical profile measurements at Poker Flat, Alaska (PFA). Present and future monthly CO2 concentrations and fluxes were simulated using the GEOS-Chem global tracer model and the Community Land Model, Version 4.5, for multiple regional flux and permafrost thaw scenarios.",

The information needed to derive this time series is also in this data set, along with extensive documentation. The longest period of coverage is from 1979 to 2001 with some sites having longer or shorter temporal coverage. Note that the GlobalView CO2 data products are derived from measurements but contain no actual data. To facilitate heterogeneous CO2 data use in carbon cycle modeling studies, the measurements have been processed (smoothed, interpolated, and extrapolated) resulting in extended records that are evenly incremented in time. There are 92 files with this data set which includes 89 *.zip data files. The other three files include 2  files with site information, one comma-delimited ASCII file (.csv), and one .dat file, and one .dat file which is a single reference marine boundary layer matrix file which contains CO2 mixing ratios as a function of time and sine of latitude and is a by-product of the data extension procedure.",

Hourly CO2 dry mole fractions (in ppm) were averaged from measurements made at different above-ground levels on the towers and are reported in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For the five Ring 2 sites, daily daytime average CO2 dry mole fractions were also calculated, from hourly values between 12:00-17:00 local standard time and reported in UTC.
