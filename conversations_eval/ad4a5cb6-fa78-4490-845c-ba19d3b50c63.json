      "text": "You're looking for datasets related to land surface albedo in South America, specifically for the period between 2000 and 2010, and in XLSX format. After conducting a thorough search, I've found a few relevant datasets that might interest you, although none directly match your specific criteria of being in XLSX format and focused solely on South America during that exact time frame.\n\n1. **Surface Spectral Albedo**: This dataset, available from the ARM Data Archive, contains surface spectral albedo data. While it doesn't specifically focus on South America, it does cover a range of locations and could be useful for comparative studies or understanding albedo variations globally. You can find it at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::surfspecalb1mlawer.\n\n2. **NLCD - MODIS land cover-albedo dataset for the continental United States**: Although this dataset is focused on the United States, it integrates high-quality MODIS albedo observations with areas of homogeneous land cover from NLCD, which could be a useful model for what you're looking for in South America. It's available at https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=A-3txd-117.\n\n3. **PROVE Surface albedo of Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, 1997**: This dataset provides surface albedo measurements from a specific location in New Mexico, which, while not in South America, could offer insights into methods of albedo measurement and analysis. Find it at https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=jornada_albedo_667&ac=true.\n\n4. **Multilayer Greenland Ice Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, and Water Vapor from MODIS V001**: This dataset includes surface albedo data, among other parameters, for Greenland. It's a comprehensive resource that could be useful for understanding albedo dynamics in polar regions. The dataset is available at https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2F7THUWT9NMPDK.\n\n5. **NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 2 Land Surface Albedo (LSA)**: This dataset provides land surface albedo data from the GOES-R ABI instrument, covering a broad area including parts of South America, though not exclusively. It's a valuable resource for recent albedo data. More information can be found at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01535/html.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these datasets exactly match your request for XLSX format and a specific focus on South America between 2000 and 2010. It's possible that such specific data might require direct contact with environmental or geographical data repositories that focus on South America, or it might be necessary to convert data from other formats to XLSX.\n\nIf you're looking for more targeted data, I recommend checking the official websites of environmental agencies or research institutions focused on South America, such as the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) or the Argentine National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA), for datasets related to land surface albedo. Additionally, international databases like the NASA Earthdata portal or the European Space Agency's (ESA) Earth Observation datasets could offer relevant information, possibly requiring format conversion.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any way I can assist further, whether it's helping with the conversion of dataset formats or guiding you through the process of contacting specific research institutions for more precise data."

      "description": "The objective of this study was to determine the spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo as related to the ground cover and under a range of solar conditions during the Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) at the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico on May 20-30, 1997. The surface albedo was sampled as described in Barnsley et al. (2000) at intervals along transects radiating north, south, east, and west from the main instrumentation tower at the transitional vegetation site. Several of these transects were sampled on more than one occasion, under a range of solar illumination conditions. At the grassland site, albedo measurements were taken along a single transect, sampled at 10-m intervals, at three different times of day (i.e., at different solar zenith angles). In addition to the albedo data, hemispherical photographs were taken at each of the sample sites to provide a visual record, and the images were classified to estimate the proportion of bare soil, live vegetation, and woody ground cover.",

These fields enable the relationship between IST and surface melt to be evaluated by researchers studying surface changes on the Greenland ice sheet. Water vapor is included to assist with evaluating the accuracy of the IST data and the model output. Also included is an ice mask and a basins mask for delineating drainage basins in Greenland.\n\nSurface temperature is a fundamental input for dynamical ice sheet models because it is a component of the ice sheet radiation budget and mass balance. Surface temperature also influences ice sheet processes, such as surface melt. This data set may be used as a resource for model-validation studies such as comparing MERRA-2 surface temperature with MODIS IST, and for comparing MODIS IST, albedo and water vapor with products from sensors on other satellites such as VIIRS and AIRS\n\nThe temporal coverage for this data set spans 1 March 2000 through 31 December 2019, with the exception of the IST data, which has been extended through 31 Aug 2021.",

The LSA is a shortwave broadband blue-sky albedo over wavelengths between 0.4 and 3.0 Âµm. Besides the blue-sky broadband shortwave albedo, the LSA algorithm also generates spectral land surface reflectance as byproducts. The frequent temporal refreshment, fine spectral resolution and large spatial coverage make ABI a unique data source for mapping LSA. The Land Surface Albedo product image is provided at 2 km resolution on the ABI fixed grid for Full Disk, CONUS, and Mesoscale coverage regions from GOES East and West.",
