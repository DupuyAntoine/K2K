      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets related to sea level rise globally between 2015 and 2023, I've conducted a search to find relevant datasets that match your criteria. Unfortunately, the available datasets I found are more focused on specific regions such as New York City or the San Francisco Bay area, and they often project sea level rise into the future (2050s, 2080s, 2100s) rather than providing historical data from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHere are a few datasets that might be of interest, although they don't perfectly match your request:\n\n1. **2080s Mean Sea Level Rise Projections**: This dataset from the New York City Panel on Climate Change (2019) provides projections for New York City in the 2080s. While it's not within your specified time frame, it could be useful for understanding future projections. Download: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/w7sh-mt94/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD\n2. **100-year storm + 66 inches Sea Level Rise**: Originating from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Adapting to Rising Tides Program, this dataset models the impact of a 100-year storm combined with 66 inches of sea level rise. It's more about the impact of sea level rise rather than the rise itself but could be useful for understanding potential effects. Download: https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/6ann-usi8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD\n3. **NOAA Office for Coastal Management Sea Level Rise Data**: Although not specifically a CSV dataset for global sea level rise between 2015 and 2023, NOAA's Office for Coastal Management provides data and tools for understanding sea level rise impacts, including a viewer for potential inundation areas due to sea level rise. It might not directly answer your question but is a valuable resource for sea level rise information. Visit: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nTo better assist you, I would like to clarify a few points:\n- Are you looking for data from a specific organization or project?\n- Do you need data on a particular aspect of sea level rise, such as absolute sea level or sea level anomaly?\n\nProviding more details could help in finding a dataset that more closely matches your requirements."

      "description": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nThese data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.5 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions in half foot increments. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).\n\nThe model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.\n\nBoth raster and vector data are provided for each sea level rise amount above MHHW. The raster data represent both the horizontal extent of inundation and depth above ground, in meters. The vector data represent the horizontal extent of both hydrologically connected and unconnected inundation. The vector \"slr\" data represent inundation that is hydrologically connected to the ocean. The vector \"low\" data represent areas that are hydrologically unconnected to the ocean, but are below the sea level rise amount and may also flood.\n\nFor more information, contact coastal.info@noaa.gov.",
