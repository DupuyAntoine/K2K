      "text": "I've searched for datasets related to carbon emissions in North America between 2010 and 2020. Based on your request, I've found several relevant datasets that might interest you. \n\nHere are the datasets I've found:\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel. While it's not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it does offer insights into energy-related emissions. You can access this data at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**: The Hestia Project quantifies, simulates, and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions. This specific dataset focuses on Indianapolis, Indiana, and provides data at the county level with a 200 m grid resolution, available from 2010 to 2015. You can find more information at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341).\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: This dataset estimates hourly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States. It covers various emission source sectors and is available in NetCDF format. The data can be accessed through [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n\nTo provide more tailored results, could you please specify if you're looking for data from a particular country or region within North America, or if there are specific sectors or sources of carbon emissions you're interested in? This will help me refine the search to better meet your needs. \n\nAdditionally, if you're looking for datasets in a specific CSV format, please let me know, and I'll do my best to find or convert the data accordingly. \n\nPlease feel free to provide any additional details or clarification regarding your request. I'm here to assist you in finding the most relevant datasets for your needs."
