      "text": "You are looking for datasets related to sea level anomalies in the Pacific Ocean, specifically from 1993 onwards. After conducting a thorough search, I have found several datasets that might be relevant to your query.\n\n1. **Reconstructed Sea Level Version 1**: This dataset contains sea level anomalies derived from satellite altimetry and tide gauges, providing a record from 1950 to 2009 with weekly temporal resolution and half-degree spatial resolution. Although it doesn't exactly match your start year of 1993, it does cover that period and offers a comprehensive view of sea level changes. You can find more information about this dataset at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\n2. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**: While this dataset starts from 2017, which is later than your specified start year, it provides experimental sea surface height anomalies from altimetry on a global scale, including the Pacific Ocean. It can be accessed through [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html).\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: This dataset provides gridded sea surface height anomalies above a mean sea surface, starting from the availability of satellite altimetry data, on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days. Although the exact start year isn't specified in the provided information, it's known that such datasets typically begin in the early 1990s with the launch of TOPEX/Poseidon. More details and access to the data can be found at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\nThese datasets were selected because they provide information on sea level anomalies, either globally or in specific regions, which can be relevant for studying changes in the Pacific Ocean since 1993. If none of these datasets exactly match your requirements, it might be helpful to specify the format or spatial resolution you're interested in or to consider datasets that start slightly before or after 1993 for a more comprehensive analysis.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or assistance in finding the most suitable dataset for your research."

NCEI, as the repository for oceanic subsurface profile data, especially for temperature and salinity profiles, has the data to calculate historic and recent changes in the above mentioned ocean variables. Data gathered from the NCEI archives, uniformly formatted and quality controlled in the World Ocean Database, are used to calculate temperature (and salinity) differences from a long-term climatological mean (the World Ocean Atlas series) at specific depth levels.  These anomalies are used to derive integrals of ocean heat content and means for all other variables listed above.",

      "description": "Simulatations of water levels in the Salish Sea for a continuous hindcast of the period October 1, 1985, to September 30, 2015 were conducted to evaluate the utility and skill of a sea-level anomaly predictor and to develop extreme water level estimates accounting for decadal climate variability. The model accounts for sea level position, tides, remote sea-level anomalies, local winds and storm surge and stream flows as they affect water density. Comparison of modeled and measured water levels showed the model predicts extreme water levels at NOAA tide gage stations within 0.15 m. Model inputs and outputs of time-series water levels along the -5 m depth isobath are presented. In addition, extreme water level recurrence for the 1-,2-,5-,10-,20-,50-, and 100-year water levels computed from annual Maxima/Generalized Extreme Value (AM/GEV) and peak-over-threshold (POT) extreme value analyses across the entire domain are presented.",

      "description": "The Reconstructed Sea Level dataset contains sea level anomalies derived from satellite altimetry and tide gauges.  The satellite altimetric record provides accurate measurements of sea level with near-global coverage, but it has a relatively short time span, since 1993. Tide gauges have measured sea level over the last 200 years, with some records extending back to 1807, but they only provide regional coverage, not global.  Combining satellite altimetry with tide gauges, using a technique known as sea level reconstruction, results in a dataset with the record length of the tide gauges and the near-global coverage of satellite altimetry.  Cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions (CSEOFs), derived from satellite altimetry, are combined with historical sea level measurements from tide gauges to create the Reconstructed Sea Level dataset spanning from 1950 through 2009. Combining the altimetric and tide gauge records alleviates the difficulties caused by the short record length and poor spatial distribution of the satellite altimetry and tide gauges, respectively.  Previous sea level reconstructions have utilized empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) as basis functions, but by using CSEOFs and by addressing other aspects of the reconstruction procedure, an alternative sea level reconstruction can be computed. The resulting reconstructed sea level dataset has weekly temporal resolution and half-degree spatial resolution.  For specific information on the algorithm and how the CSEOFs are applied to the tide gauge data please see Hamlington et al. 2011.",

      "description": "Sea surface temperature (SST) plays an important role in a number of ecological processes and can vary over a wide range of time scales, from daily to decadal changes. SST influences primary production, species migration patterns, and coral health. If temperatures are anomalously warm for extended periods of time, drastic changes in the surrounding ecosystem can result, including harmful effects such as coral bleaching. This layer represents the annual average of the maximum anomaly of SST (degrees Celsius) from 2000-2013.\n\nThree SST datasets were combined to provide continuous coverage from 1985-2013. The concatenation applies bias adjustment derived from linear regression to the overlap periods of datasets, with the final representation matching the 0.05-degree (~5-km) near real-time SST product. First, a weekly composite, gap-filled SST dataset from the NOAA Pathfinder v5.2 SST 1/24-degree (~4-km), daily dataset (a NOAA Climate Data Record) for each location was produced following Heron et al. (2010) for January 1985 to December 2012. Next, weekly composite SST data from the NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Blended SST 0.1-degree (~11-km), daily dataset was produced for February 2009 to October 2013. Finally, a weekly composite SST dataset from the NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Blended SST 0.05-degree (~5-km), daily dataset was produced for March 2012 to December 2013.\n\nThe SST average annual maximum anomaly was calculated by taking the average of the annual maximum SST values in exceedance of the maximum monthly climatological SST from 2000-2013 for each pixel.",

      "description": "For the purposes of this paper, the National\r\nAirspace System (NAS) encompasses the operations of all\r\naircraft which are subject to air traffic control procedures.\r\nThe NAS is a highly complex dynamic system that is\r\nsensitive to aeronautical decision-making and risk management\r\nskills. In order to ensure a healthy system with safe\r\nflights a systematic approach to anomaly detection is very\r\nimportant when evaluating a given set of circumstances\r\nand for determination of the best possible course of action.\r\nGiven the fact that the NAS is a vast and loosely integrated\r\nnetwork of systems, it requires improved safety assurance\r\ncapabilities to maintain an extremely low accident rate\r\nunder increasingly dense operating conditions. Data mining\r\nbased tools and techniques are required to support and aid\r\noperators’ (such as pilots, management, or policy makers)\r\noverall decision-making capacity. Within the NAS, the\r\nability to analyze fleetwide aircraft data autonomously is\r\nstill considered a significantly challenging task. For our\r\npurposes a fleet is defined as a group of aircraft sharing\r\ngenerally compatible parameter lists. Here, in this effort,\r\nwe aim at developing a system level analysis scheme. In this\r\npaper we address the capability for detection of fleetwide\r\nanomalies as they occur, which itself is an important\r\ninitiative toward the safety of the real-world flight operations.\r\nThe flight data recorders archive millions of data\r\npoints with valuable information on flights everyday. The\r\noperational parameters consist of both continuous and discrete\r\n(binary & categorical) data from several critical subsystems\r\nand numerous complex procedures. In this paper,\r\nwe discuss a system level anomaly detection approach based\r\non the theory of kernel learning to detect potential safety\r\nanomalies in a very large data base of commercial aircraft.\r\nWe also demonstrate that the proposed approach uncovers\r\nsome operationally significant events due to environmental,\r\nmechanical, and human factors issues in high dimensional,\r\nmultivariate Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA)\r\ndata. We present the results of our detection algorithms on\r\nreal FOQA data from a regional carrier.",
