      "text": "Based on your request for XLS datasets of precipitation totals in Asia between 1990 and 2000, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the provided datasets don't exactly match your criteria, as they are mostly related to total precipitable water vapor rather than direct precipitation totals. However, I can guide you through the closest matches and suggest potential next steps.\n\nThe datasets I found are primarily from NASA and other research institutions, focusing on total precipitable water vapor, which is related to precipitation but not the same. For example:\n\n1. **NASA Water Vapor Project MEaSUREs (NVAP-M)**: This dataset includes total precipitable water vapor products, which could be relevant for understanding precipitation patterns, although it doesn't directly provide precipitation totals. It's available in netCDF format, not XLS, but could be useful for climate research.\n2. **RSS MONTHLY 1-DEG MICROWAVE TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER NETCDF V7R01**: Similar to the NVAP-M dataset, this provides global total columnar water vapor values over ocean areas, which might be useful for broader climate studies but doesn't specifically address precipitation totals over Asia.\n\nGiven the discrepancy between the available datasets and your specific request for precipitation totals in Asia from 1990 to 2000 in XLS format, I recommend the following steps:\n\n- **Refine Your Search**: Consider if there are specific countries or regions within Asia you're interested in, as this might help narrow down the search.\n- **Alternative Formats**: Be open to datasets in formats other than XLS, such as CSV or netCDF, which can often be converted to XLS with the right tools.\n- **Direct Contact with Data Providers**: Sometimes, directly contacting research institutions or data repositories can yield more specific results, especially if they have datasets that aren't widely listed or are in the process of being published.\n\nIf you have any more details or would like to refine your search based on these suggestions, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

Additional data includes measurements of temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, pressure, and solar and infrared radiation flux. These data were gathered during the GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) at the CARE and SkyDive sites in Ontario, Canada during November 7, 2011 - February 21, 2012. These data sets were collected to aid in the achievement of the over arching goal of GCPEx which is to characterize the ability of multi-frequency active and passive microwave sensors to detect and estimate falling snow.",

This dataset contains monthly, 1-degree TPW means, a 12-month climatology made using 1988 to 2007 data, monthly anomaly maps, a trend map with associated global and tropical TPW time series and trends, and a time-latitude plot. The 1 degree TPW dataset is a merged ocean product constructed using version 7 (V7) passive microwave geophysical ocean products made publicly available by RSS (www.remss.com). TPW values for this dataset were acquired from the following satellite microwave radiometers: SSM/I F08 through F15, SSMIS F16 and F17, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat. The radiometers used to construct this dataset were were inter-calibrated at the brightness temperature level, while the V7 ocean products were produced using a consistent processing methodology across sensors.",

      "description": "NVAP_OCEAN_Total-Precipitable-Water data set includes only data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and intends to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets. The data set is used for studies of climate change, interannual variability, and independent comparison to other ocean-only data sets. The new NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) data sets are produced under the NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program and is named NVAP-M. It supersedes the previous NVAP data set. NVAP-M continues the legacy of providing high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The use of improved, intercalibrated data sets and algorithms that were not available for the heritage NVAP data set results in an improved and extended water vapor data set that is stable enough for climate research and of a resolution appropriate for studies on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The true value of NVAP-M will be seen in outcomes from applied and research users of the data set in various fields. Some initial NVAP-M findings are presented in Vonder Haar et al. (2012). In addition to the time-dependent artifacts present in the previous NVAP data set, a wealth of new data has become available since the last NVAP processing in 2003. These include an additional SSM/I instrument, additional NOAA satellites, the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)-Aqua Satellite, which carries the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well as water vapor information from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. This extension and reprocessing effort increases the temporal coverage from 14 to 22 (1988-2009) years, making the data set more useful and consistent for investigation of the long-term trends which are hypothesized to occur as Earth warms. In addition to the long-standing daily, 1-degree gridded Total Precipitable Water (TPW) and layered Precipitable Water (PW) products, NVAP-M includes additional products geared towards different scientific needs. Three separate processing streams produced products directed towards specific research goals. These are NVAP-M Climate, designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications, and NVAP-M Weather, designed to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution products for use in studies on shorter time scales as well as weather case studies. Additionally, an ocean-only (NVAP-M Ocean) version includes only data from the SSM/I and is intended to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets.",
