      "text": "I've searched for datasets that match your request for GEOJSON files containing surface temperature anomalies in Europe between 1980 and 1990. Although the exact match is challenging due to the specificity of the format (GEOJSON) and the temporal range, I've found some related datasets that might be useful for your research:\n\n1. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - HadCRUT3 global surface temperature anomalies since 1850**: This dataset, although not in GEOJSON format, provides global surface temperature anomalies, including Europe, from 1850 onwards. You can potentially extract the European data and convert it into GEOJSON format for your analysis. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.25921/s4xj-0863.\n\n2. **GISS Surface Temperature Analysis**: The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) offers a global 2x2 gridded temperature anomaly dataset. While it's not limited to Europe and not in GEOJSON, it does cover the period from 1980 to 1990 and could be useful with further processing. More details can be found at https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/Datasets/gistemp/catalog.html.\n\n3. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets from PACIOOS**: Several datasets related to sea surface temperature anomalies are available, particularly for regions like Hawaii and American Samoa, but they do not directly match your request for European land surface temperature anomalies. However, they demonstrate the availability of temperature anomaly data in various formats, which might inspire alternative approaches to your search.\n\nGiven the constraints of your search, it appears that datasets specifically in GEOJSON format focusing on European surface temperature anomalies between 1980 and 1990 are not readily available in the searched repositories. For a more precise match, I recommend considering the following steps:\n\n- **Specify the producer or dataset/source**: If you have a particular organization or dataset in mind that might have published this specific type of data, please let me know, and I can attempt a more targeted search.\n- **Consider alternative formats**: While GEOJSON is preferred, analyzing data in other formats (like CSV or NetCDF) and then converting it might be a viable workaround.\n- **Broaden the search**: Looking into research papers or projects focused on European climate anomalies during the 1980s might yield usable data, even if it requires conversion or processing.\n\nIf you have any additional details or would like to explore these alternatives, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you further."
