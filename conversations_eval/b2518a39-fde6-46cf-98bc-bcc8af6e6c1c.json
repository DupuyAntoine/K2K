      "text": "You are looking for GEOJSON datasets of carbon emissions in North America, specifically covering the period between 2010 and 2020. Based on the search results, several datasets seem relevant to your query, although some may require further specification or processing to exactly match your requirements.\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel, which can be related to carbon emissions. It's available at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/). While not directly in GEOJSON format, the data could potentially be converted or used in conjunction with geographic information systems (GIS) to match your spatial needs.\n\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**, and **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Baltimore, Maryland**: These datasets are part of the Hestia Project, which quantifies and visualizes greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. Although focused on specific cities, they provide high-resolution data (at the county level with 200m grid resolution) from 2010 to 2015. These can be found at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341) and [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342), respectively. The data is detailed but might need aggregation or combination with other datasets for a comprehensive North America view.\n\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: Provided by NASA, this dataset estimates hourly carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States. It covers the years 2012 through 2017 and is divided into ten distinct emissions source sectors. The data is available in NetCDF format at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true). While not directly in GEOJSON, the high spatial resolution could be utilized in a GIS for conversion or analysis.\n\n4. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides data products for several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and the Northeast corridor, quantifying greenhouse gases emitted by urban regions. Available from 2010, these datasets offer high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations. The data can be accessed at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nTo better assist you, it would be helpful to know if you have a specific country or region within North America you're interested in, or if there are particular sectors or types of carbon emissions you'd like to focus on. Additionally, the level of detail or granularity for the GEOJSON data (e.g., country, state, city) could help narrow down the search."
