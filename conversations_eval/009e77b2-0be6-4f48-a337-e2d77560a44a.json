      "text": "Based on your request for XLS datasets of solar radiation in Africa between 2015 and 2023, I have conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the search results did not yield datasets that exactly match your criteria, particularly for the African continent and the specified time frame in XLS format. However, I can provide you with some relevant information and suggest potential next steps.\n\nThe datasets I found are primarily from reputable sources such as NASA, NOAA, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), but they may not be specifically tailored to Africa or may not be in XLS format. For instance, the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) provides comprehensive solar radiation data, but its primary focus is on the United States, with some international locations. You can explore the [NSRDB](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/nsrdb/) for potential applicability or to see if any African locations are included.\n\nAnother option could be the [Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN)](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::bsrn), which offers solar irradiance data, although it might not perfectly match your geographic and temporal requirements.\n\nTo better assist you, I would like to clarify a few points:\n1. Are you open to exploring datasets that cover a broader geographic area than Africa, with the possibility of extracting African data?\n2. Would you consider datasets in formats other than XLS, such as CSV, which could be easily converted?\n3. Are there specific types of solar radiation measurements (e.g., global horizontal, direct normal, diffuse horizontal irradiance) you are interested in?\n\nPlease let me know if there's any additional information I can provide or if you'd like to refine your search based on these suggestions."

At the heart of this was a carefully stacked Twin Otter and Egrett cloud sandwich with the Otter at 1500 - 5000 feet and the Egrett at 43,000 feet overflown by an ER-2 flying at 65,000 feet.",

The current NSRDB is modeled using multi-channel measurements from geostationary satellites. The older versions of the NSRDB were modeled using cloud and weather information primarily collected at airports.

      "description": "The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) is a serially complete collection of meteorological and solar irradiance data sets for the United States and a growing list of international locations for 1998-2023. The NSRDB is updated annually and provides foundational information to support U.S. Department of Energy programs, research, industry and the general public.\n\nThe NSRDB provides time-series data at 30-minute resolution of resource averaged over surface cells of 0.038 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or nominally 4 km in size. Additionally time series data at 5 minutes for the US and 10 minutes for North, Central and South America at 2 km resolution are produced from the next generation of GOES satellites and made available from 2019. The solar radiation values represent the resource available to solar energy systems. The data was created using cloud properties which are generated using the AVHRR Pathfinder Atmospheres-Extended (PATMOS-x) algorithms developed by the University of Wisconsin. Fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) in conjunction with the cloud properties, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) and precipitable water vapor (PWV) from ancillary source are used to estimate solar irradiance (GHI, DNI, and DHI). The Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) is computed for clear skies using the REST2 model. For cloud scenes identified by the cloud mask, FARMS is used to compute GHI and FARMS DNI is used to compute the Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI). The PATMOS-X model uses radiance images in visible and infrared channels from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series of geostationary weather satellites. Ancillary variables needed to run REST2 and FARMS (e.g., aerosol optical depth, precipitable water vapor, and albedo) are derived from NASA's Modern Era-Retrospective Analysis (MERRA-2) dataset. Temperature and wind speed data are also derived from MERRA-2 and provided for use in NREL's System Advisor Model (SAM) to compute PV generation.",
