      "text": "I've searched for datasets related to surface temperature anomalies in Europe between 1980 and 1990 in XLS format. Unfortunately, the initial search did not yield exact matches that fit all your criteria, including the specific format (XLS) and the geographical and temporal constraints. However, I found some related datasets that might be useful for your research:\n\n1. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - HadCRUT3 global surface temperature anomalies since 1850**: This dataset, while not limited to Europe or the 1980-1990 period, does provide global surface temperature anomalies that could be useful for understanding broader trends. It's available from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n2. **GISS Surface Temperature Analysis**: Provided by NASA, this dataset offers global temperature data, including for the European region, though it might require some filtering to match your specific temporal and spatial needs.\n\n3. **Surface Temperature Anomalies Derived from Night Time ASTER Data**: Although these datasets (available for different counties and not specifically for Europe) focus on nighttime temperature anomalies, they demonstrate the kind of detailed, localized temperature anomaly data that exists.\n\nFor datasets specifically focused on Europe between 1980 and 1990, I recommend checking directly with European environmental agencies or research institutions, as they might have more targeted data. The European Environment Agency (EEA) could be a good place to start, along with national meteorological services in European countries.\n\nIf you're flexible with the data format, there are more options available, including CSV, NetCDF, and others, which might offer the precise geographical and temporal coverage you're looking for.\n\nTo assist further, could you:\n- Specify if there's a particular aspect of surface temperature anomalies you're interested in (e.g., land, sea, urban areas)?\n- Consider if data from a slightly broader period or in a different format could be useful?\n- Provide more details on the intended use of the data, which might help in suggesting alternative datasets or sources?\n\nPlease let me know how I can assist you further in your search for the right dataset."
