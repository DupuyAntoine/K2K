      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of land surface albedo in South America between 2000 and 2010, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the initial search results did not yield datasets that perfectly match your criteria, specifically for South America and within the 2000-2010 timeframe in CSV format.\n\nHowever, several datasets related to land surface albedo and covering various geographical areas, including parts of South America, were found. These datasets might be useful for your research or could serve as a starting point for further investigation:\n\n1. **NLCD - MODIS land cover-albedo dataset for the continental United States**: While not specifically focused on South America, this dataset integrates MODIS albedo observations with land cover from NLCD, offering insights into albedo changes over time in the continental United States.\n2. **Multilayer Greenland Ice Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, and Water Vapor from MODIS V001**: This dataset, though focused on Greenland, includes albedo data and might be of interest for comparative studies or understanding albedo dynamics in different regions.\n3. **NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 2 Land Surface Albedo (LSA)**: Provides land surface albedo data, which could be useful for understanding albedo over South America, though specific filtering for your time frame and region might be necessary.\n\nTo refine your search or find more targeted data, I recommend clarifying a few details:\n- Are you looking for data from a specific country or region within South America?\n- Do you have a preferred data provider or organization for this dataset?\n- Would you consider datasets in formats other than CSV, or are there specific reasons you need CSV?\n\nThese questions can help narrow down the search to datasets that more closely match your requirements. Additionally, exploring databases from organizations like NASA, NOAA, or regional environmental agencies in South America might yield more targeted results."

      "description": "The objective of this study was to determine the spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo as related to the ground cover and under a range of solar conditions during the Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) at the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico on May 20-30, 1997. The surface albedo was sampled as described in Barnsley et al. (2000) at intervals along transects radiating north, south, east, and west from the main instrumentation tower at the transitional vegetation site. Several of these transects were sampled on more than one occasion, under a range of solar illumination conditions. At the grassland site, albedo measurements were taken along a single transect, sampled at 10-m intervals, at three different times of day (i.e., at different solar zenith angles). In addition to the albedo data, hemispherical photographs were taken at each of the sample sites to provide a visual record, and the images were classified to estimate the proportion of bare soil, live vegetation, and woody ground cover.",

The LSA is a shortwave broadband blue-sky albedo over wavelengths between 0.4 and 3.0 Âµm. Besides the blue-sky broadband shortwave albedo, the LSA algorithm also generates spectral land surface reflectance as byproducts. The frequent temporal refreshment, fine spectral resolution and large spatial coverage make ABI a unique data source for mapping LSA. The Land Surface Albedo product image is provided at 2 km resolution on the ABI fixed grid for Full Disk, CONUS, and Mesoscale coverage regions from GOES East and West.",
