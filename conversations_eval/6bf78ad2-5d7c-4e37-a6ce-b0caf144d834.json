      "text": "I've searched for NETCDF datasets related to lake surface area in the Arctic region between 1980 and 1990. Although the exact match is challenging due to the specificity of the request, I've found some relevant datasets that might be of interest to you:\n\n1. **Pre SWOT Hydrology Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Area Extent V2**: This dataset, available from the PODAAC (Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center), provides surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs worldwide, including those in the Arctic region. While it doesn't precisely match your temporal range (it covers roughly 2000 to present), it's a valuable resource for understanding long-term trends in lake surface areas. You can find more information and access the data at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\n2. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - Pupuke Lake Holocene Air and Lake Surface Temperature Reconstructions**: Although this dataset from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information focuses on paleoclimatology and air/lake surface temperature reconstructions, it might offer insights into historical lake conditions, including surface area changes. The data covers a time period from approximately 16138 to 12 years before present, which is broader than your requested range but could be useful for contextualizing longer-term changes. More details are available at [https://doi.org/10.25921/hgwy-fn08](https://doi.org/10.25921/hgwy-fn08).\n\nGiven the specificity of your request (NETCDF format, Arctic region, 1980-1990), I couldn't find an exact match. To refine the search, could you please provide more details or clarify if there's a specific lake or aspect of lake surface area you're interested in? Additionally, are there any particular producers or sources you prefer for the datasets? This information would help in conducting a more targeted search."

      "description": "The Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Extent Mask Time Series are derived from the MODIS instruments. The purpose of this dataset is to provide surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs throughout the globe, with a base temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 meters. With the exception of periods of low-quality input data, these time series will extend across the lifespan of the MODIS multispectral reflectance products, from roughly 2000 to present. These time series will allow us to satisfy the project goal to produce ESDRs of suitable quality to support long-term trend analysis and global water dynamics models for the longest length possible (in most cases, about 20 years, the length of the altimetry record) of key measures of surface water storages and fluxes. This product should be accessible and of direct use to both water managers and the scientific community worldwide, and will allow for improved assessment and modeling of human impact on the global water cycle. These pre SWOT data are derived from satellites to provide hydrological measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will have hydrology as one of its objectives. This dataset does not have the same variables as SWOT, but does provide hydrological measurements with typical quality flagging typical of satellite data. Not only does it provide science information, it can also assist hydrological users new to satellite data with the satellite data formats and variables before SWOT launches.",

Unlike a digital elevation model (DEM), the DSM represents the elevation of the highest object within the bounds of a cell. Vegetation, buildings and other objects have not been removed from the data. In addition, data artifacts resulting from noise and vegetation in the original imagery have not been removed. However, in unvegetated areas such as reservoir shorelines and deltas, the DSM is equivalent to a DEM because it represents the ground surface elevation. The raw imagery used to create this DSM was acquired from a manned aircraft on 2020-11-10. The acquisition flight was conducted by The 111th Group Aerial Photography, using a Hasselblad A6D-100c camera. The imagery was acquired from an approximate altitude of 880 meters (2,900 feet) above ground level, to produce a nominal ground sample distance (pixel size) of 5 centimeters (2 inches). An onboard dual-frequency GPS receiver was used to record the precise time and position of each image. Coordinates for ground control points consisting of photo-identifiable objects were measured independently using survey-grade post-processed kinematic (PPK) GPS.",

      "description": "Clear Lake is a 180 km2 freshwater lake located approximately 120 km northwest of Sacramento in the California Coast Range. The lake is a popular sport-fishing destination, however, there are fish consumption advisories associated with mercury (Hg) contamination for several species. The lake has three arms: a large open-water region to the northwest (Upper Arm), a smaller and narrower region to the southeast (Lower Arm), and the smallest and narrowest region to the east (Oaks Arm). The Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), located on the eastern shore of the Oaks Arm, was mined by underground methods starting in the 1870s and then open-pit methods during the 1920s to 1950s. Since 1992, the SBMM has been a Superfund site managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This former Hg mining area is thought to be the dominant contributor of Hg to Clear Lake and is the focus of continued remediation to minimize Hg impacts to Clear Lake. The SBMM area is an active geothermal area with springs and gas fumaroles. \nClear Lake is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, based on elevated concentrations of nutrients (various forms of nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) that cause excessive algal blooms and periodic fish kills. There are current studies underway (by the University of California, Davis, UCD) to improve the understanding of nutrient cycling within the lake. The UCD group is developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic computer model (https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Blue-Ribbon-Committee-for-the-Rehabilitation-of-Clear-Lake/2022-BRC-Annual-Report-_20230110_DraftFinal.pdf ) of the lake that simulates periodic stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as nutrient dynamics. An effort is planned during 2023-2025 to add mercury cycling to the 3-D model. Monitoring and modeling efforts are being implemented to improve understanding of the ways that nutrient dynamics affect the cycling, transport and bioaccumulation of Hg, which remains poorly understood. \nThis data release documents the results of water-quality sampling during June 2020 through June 2022. It includes three data tables given as machine readable 'comma-separated values' format (*.csv):  1) ‘T1_CL_DataDictionary’, the Data Dictionary, which provides definitions and details related to the other two data tables and includes citations of analytical methods; 2) ‘T2_CL_Discrete_SW’, the discrete-sample surface-water dataset including concentration data for Hg species (including total mercury and methylmercury in dissolved and particulate forms) and nutrients (including several forms of N and P); and 3) ‘T3_CL_QA_SW’, a quality assurance data summary for the discrete water samples. In addition, file ‘Clear Lake Coordinates_SW 2020-22_052324’ provides the sampling locations in a machine-readable geospatial file format (*.kmz).",
