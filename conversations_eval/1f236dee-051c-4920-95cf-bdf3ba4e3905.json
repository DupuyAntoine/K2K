      "text": "Based on your search for surface temperature anomalies in Europe between 1980 and 1990 in CSV format, I have found a few relevant datasets that might be of interest to you.\n\n1. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - HadCRUT3 global surface temperature anomalies since 1850**: This dataset from NOAA provides global surface temperature anomalies and includes data for Europe during the specified time period (1980-1990). Although it's a global dataset, you can extract the European data. The dataset is available in various formats, but you can request it in CSV.\n\n2. **GISS Surface Temperature Analysis**: The Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) offers a global 2x2 gridded temperature anomaly dataset. This dataset covers the period from 1980 to 1990 and includes data for Europe. It's updated regularly and can be downloaded in a format that can be easily converted to CSV.\n\n3. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets from NOAA and other sources**: While primarily focusing on sea surface temperatures, some of these datasets, like those from NOAA's Pathfinder program or the Coral Reef Watch, might contain relevant information on surface temperature anomalies for coastal Europe. They often provide data in CSV or similar formats for easy analysis.\n\nTo access these datasets, you can visit the following links:\n- NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology: https://doi.org/10.25921/s4xj-0863\n- GISS Surface Temperature Analysis: https://psl.noaa.gov/thredds/catalog/Datasets/gistemp/catalog.html\n\nFor the sea surface temperature datasets, you can explore them through the NOAA or NASA websites, as they are updated frequently and might require specific searches for the European region and the 1980-1990 time frame.\n\nIf none of these datasets precisely match your requirements, it might be helpful to specify whether you are looking for land surface temperature anomalies, sea surface temperature anomalies, or a combination of both, as this could affect the search results. Additionally, providing more details about the producer or source of the dataset you're interested in could help narrow down the search."
