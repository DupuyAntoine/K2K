      "text": "You are looking for datasets related to carbon emissions in North America for the period between 2010 and 2020, specifically in XLS format. Based on your request, I have found several relevant datasets that might interest you.\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel, which can be related to carbon emissions. Although not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it offers valuable insights into energy consumption patterns across North America. You can find this dataset at https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/.\n\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**, and **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Baltimore, Maryland**: These datasets are part of the Hestia Project, which quantifies, simulates, and visualizes greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide emitted in urban regions. The data is provided at the county level with a 200 m grid resolution and covers hourly and yearly time frames from 2010 to 2015. You can access these datasets at https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341 and https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342, respectively.\n\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: This dataset provides estimates of hourly carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States, covering the years 2012 through 2017. It reports emissions from ten distinct source sectors and is available in NetCDF format, which might require conversion to XLS for your purposes. The dataset can be found at https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true.\n\n4. **Reactive Organic Carbon Emissions from Volatile Chemical Products**: While not directly focused on carbon emissions from fossil fuels, this dataset contains an Excel file with values related to VOCs from volatile chemical products, which could be relevant for understanding certain aspects of carbon emissions. It's available at https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1520157/maintext_figs.xlsx.\n\n5. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations at sub-county resolutions and annual/hourly time scales for several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Baltimore, from 2010 onwards. Although it doesn't cover the entirety of North America, it offers detailed insights into urban carbon emissions. You can find it at https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503.\n\nThese datasets were selected based on their relevance to carbon emissions in North America during the specified time period. However, please note that some of these datasets might not be in XLS format and could require conversion or might focus on specific regions rather than the entirety of North America.\n\nIf you're looking for more comprehensive or specific data, could you please provide more details about the producer or source of the dataset you're interested in, or any particular aspects of carbon emissions you'd like to explore (e.g., emissions from fossil fuels, land use changes, industrial processes)? This would help refine the search to better match your requirements."
