      "text": "You are looking for datasets related to sea surface height anomalies specifically in North America, covering the period from 2010 to 2020, and you need the data in CSV format. \n\nAfter conducting a search, several relevant datasets have been identified that may match your requirements. Here are a few:\n\n1. **Sea Surface Height** from the Marine Cadastre dataset, which includes monthly and annual summaries of global sea surface height anomalies. Although it's not exclusive to North America, it covers the region and is available from 1992 to 2016. You can find it at https://marinecadastre.gov/downloads/data/mc/SeaSurfaceHeight.zip.\n\n2. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**. This dataset from NOAA provides global sea surface height anomalies derived from altimetry data, available from 2017 onwards. While it's more recent than your specified time frame and global in scope, it might still be useful for understanding recent trends. It can be accessed at https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html.\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205** offers gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days, from multiple satellite missions. This dataset is broad in coverage, including North America, but you would need to select the specific time frame and region of interest. More details are available at https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC.\n\n4. Other datasets from NASA and NOAA involving sea surface height anomalies, such as **NASA-SSH PDO Sea Surface Height Indicator**, **NASA-SSH IOD Sea Surface Height Indicator**, and **SARAL Near-Real-Time Value-added Operational Geophysical Data Record Sea Surface Height Anomaly**, might also be relevant, although they may require additional processing to fit your exact specifications.\n\nTo precisely match your needs, I recommend checking the temporal and spatial coverage of each dataset and potentially contacting the data providers for customized data extraction, especially if the datasets are not directly available in CSV format or do not perfectly align with your specified time frame and geographic region.\n\nIf these options do not fully meet your requirements, please provide more details or clarify your needs for a more targeted search."

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction.
