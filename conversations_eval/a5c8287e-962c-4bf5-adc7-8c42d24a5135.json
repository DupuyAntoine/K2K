      "text": "You are looking for data on snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere for the period of 2005-2015. After conducting a search, I have found several datasets that may be relevant to your query.\n\n1. **Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent**: This dataset, available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), provides weekly snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere from September 1980 onward at a 24 km resolution. Although it starts before your specified period, it does cover the years 2005-2015. You can access it at https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10035/.\n\n2. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: Offered by NOAA, this dataset contains monthly North American snow cover extent derived from weekly values. While it specifically mentions North America, it's part of a broader Northern Hemisphere dataset. You can find more information at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html.\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Northern Hemisphere Terrestrial Snow Cover Extent Daily 25km EASE-Grid 2.0**: This dataset from NASA provides daily snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere at a 25 km resolution. It includes data from 2000 to 2017, covering your period of interest. The data can be accessed through https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FMEASURES%2FCRYOSPHERE%2Fnsidc-0530.001.\n\n4. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: Another dataset from NSIDC, this one offers weekly snow cover and sea ice extent on the Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid 2.0 projection at a 25 km grid cell size. It covers from October 1966 through recent times, thus including your target years. You can find it at https://daacdata.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/nsidc0046_weekly_snow_seaice/.\n\nEach of these datasets was selected because it matches your criteria of focusing on snow cover extent in the Northern Hemisphere and covers at least part of the 2005-2015 time frame. They vary in resolution, frequency (daily, weekly, monthly), and specific geographic focus but all contribute valuable information on snow cover dynamics during your period of interest.\n\nIf you need more specific data or a particular format (like CSV or JSON), please let me know, and I can try to assist you further or guide you on how to convert the available data into your desired format."

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",

      "description": "This dataset provides estimates of maximum snow cover extent (SCE) and snow depth for each 8-day composite period from 2001 to 2017 at 1 km resolution across Alaska. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas covered by perennial ice/snow or open water. A downscaling scheme was used in which Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis 0.5 degree snow depth data were interpolated to a finer 1 km spatial grid.  In the methods used, the downscaling scheme incorporated MODIS SCE (MOD10A2) to better account for the influence of local topography on the 1km snow distribution patterns.  For MODIS cloud-contaminated pixels, persistent and patchy cloud cover conditions were improved by applying an elevation-based spatial filtering algorithm to predict snow occurrence.  Cloud-free MODIS SCE data were then used to downscale MERRA-2 snow depth data.  For each snow-covered 1 km pixel indicated by the MODIS data, the snow depth was estimated based on the snow depth of the neighboring MERRA-2 0.5 grid cell, with weights predicted using a spatial filter.",

The land cover classification maps feature between three and six classes common to mountainous regions and integral for accurate stereo snow depth mapping: illuminated snow, shaded snow, vegetation, exposed surfaces, surface water, and clouds. Also included are Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA map products. The source imagery for these data are the Maxar WorldView-2 and Maxar WorldView-3 Level-1B 8-band multispectral images, orthorectified and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. These Level-1B images are available under the NGA NextView/EnhancedView license.",
