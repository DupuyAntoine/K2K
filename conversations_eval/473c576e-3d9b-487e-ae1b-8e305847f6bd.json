      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of river discharge in Africa between 2015 and 2023, I've searched through various datasets to find the most relevant ones for you. Unfortunately, the search results didn't yield a precise match for river discharge data specific to Africa for the years 2015-2023 in CSV format from a single, specific producer or dataset/source. However, I found several datasets that might be of interest to you, albeit not perfectly matching your criteria.\n\n1. **Global River Discharge, 1807-1991, V[ersion]. 1.1 (RivDIS)**: This dataset, available from NASA, contains monthly averaged discharge measurements for 1,018 stations globally, including some in Africa, but the time frame is from 1807 to 1991. It's in ASCII format, which can be easily converted to CSV. While it doesn't match your time frame, it's a comprehensive global dataset that includes African rivers.\n\n2. **SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: This dataset is a subset of the CPEP Global River Discharge Data Set, focused on southern Africa. It provides monthly mean discharge data but doesn't specifically match the 2015-2023 time frame you're interested in.\n\n3. **SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products Version 1**: Although not exclusively focused on Africa, this dataset from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission provides estimates of river discharge globally, including Africa, and is more contemporary. However, it might require some processing to extract the specific data you need for Africa between 2015 and 2023.\n\nTo find a more precise match, I would need more specific information about the producer of the dataset or a particular dataset/source you're interested in. Additionally, clarifying if you're looking for data from a specific river or region within Africa could help narrow down the search.\n\nFor now, you can explore the datasets mentioned above, which, although not perfectly matching your requirements, offer valuable information on river discharge and can be found at the following links:\n- Global River Discharge: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=rivdis_199&ac=true\n- SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=river_discharge_cpep_640&ac=true\n- SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products: https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with converting data formats or accessing these datasets, please let me know."

The SWOT mission is implemented jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.Sword of Science data products are generated from the open-source SWOT Confluence program and contain river discharge parameter estimates as well as discharge time series for both river reaches and river nodes, following the SWOT River Database (SWORD) structure. Granules from both constrained and unconstrained branches are composed of prior information (e.g., mean annual flow predicted by global hydrological models) and the resulting discharge estimates. Priors and results files for both constrained and unconstrained branches are available in netCDF format. Users are encouraged to reference the SWOT Confluence documentation and notebook tutorials for full documentation of the data structure and variables available.Development of the SWOT Confluence program as well as the Sword of Science data products was funded by NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program.",

The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10° N to 25° S, 30° to 85° W).The global river discharge data set (Coe and Olejniczak 1999), formerly known as the \"Climate, People, and Environment Program (CPEP) Global River Discharge Database,\" is a compilation of monthly mean discharge data for more than 2600 sites worldwide. The data were compiled from RivDIS Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy.
