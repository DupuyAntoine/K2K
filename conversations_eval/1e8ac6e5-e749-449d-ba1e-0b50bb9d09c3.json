      "text": "Based on your search criteria, I've found several datasets related to aerosol optical depth in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000. Although none of the retrieved datasets exactly match your request for CSV format and the specific time period, I can suggest some alternatives that might be helpful:\n\n1. **NIMFR: derived total & aerosol optical depth from 1st Michalsky algorithm**: This dataset, available from the ARM Data Archive, provides aerosol optical depth data but does not explicitly state it covers Antarctica or the exact time frame you're interested in. However, it's a relevant dataset that could be useful with further filtering. You can find more information at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::nimfraod1mich.\n\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, NIR Aerosol Optical Depths** and **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths**: These datasets from the ARM Data Archive offer aerosol optical depth measurements but are not specifically tailored to Antarctica or the 1990-2000 period. They can be accessed at http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sasheniraod and http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sashevisaod, respectively.\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001**: This dataset from NASA's Earth Observing System provides monthly mean MODIS Level 3 data, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE), but it focuses on High Mountain Asia, not Antarctica. It's available at https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FD0SO1YA0B9EY.\n\n4. **Earth Observatory Aerosol Optical Depth**: While not a dataset per se, NASA's Earth Observatory has resources and information on aerosol optical depth, including how it's measured and its significance. You can find this at https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_OD&eocn=home&eoci=globalmaps, though it does not directly provide downloadable CSV files for your specific query.\n\nTo find datasets that more closely match your criteria, I recommend checking databases like the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) or the NOAA Climate Data Online repository, which might have more specific data on aerosol optical depth in Antarctica during the 1990-2000 period. Additionally, contacting researchers or institutions focused on Antarctic studies might yield more targeted results.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or can refine your search criteria, I'd be happy to try and assist further."

      "description": "The NASA Ames Airborne Tracking 14-channel Sunphotometer (AATS-14) was operated successfully aboard the University of Washington CV-580 for 24 data flights during the dry-season airborne campaign from August 13 to September 25, 2000. Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
