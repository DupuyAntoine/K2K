      "text": "Based on your search for carbon emissions datasets in North America between 2010 and 2020 in XLSX format, I've found several relevant datasets that might interest you. \n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data** from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel. Although not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it offers insights into energy-related emissions at the state level. You can access this data at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n\n2. The **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions** datasets for specific cities like Indianapolis, Indiana, and Baltimore, Maryland, are available. These datasets, part of the Hestia Project, quantify and simulate greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, at high spatial and temporal resolutions. You can find these datasets at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341) for Indianapolis and [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342) for Baltimore.\n\n3. For a broader perspective, the **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**, offers estimates of hourly carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States. This dataset is available in NetCDF format and can be accessed through [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n\n4. **Reactive Organic Carbon Emissions from Volatile Chemical Products** is another dataset that, while not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, provides insights into VOCs from volatile chemical products, which can be relevant for understanding certain aspects of carbon emissions. This dataset includes Python code and inputs for VCPy v1.0, along with an Excel file containing main text figures, available at [https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1520157/maintext_figs.xlsx](https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1520157/maintext_figs.xlsx).\n\n5. **Global Fire carbon emissions from CMS-Flux inversions assimilating atmospheric carbon monoxide observations** provides carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide flux from fires constrained by satellite observations, although it's more global in scope. This dataset can be found at [https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/public/project/CMS/GlobFireCarbon_1.png](https://docserver.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/public/project/CMS/GlobFireCarbon_1.png).\n\n6. Lastly, the **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions** offers data products for several U.S. cities, quantifying greenhouse gases emitted by urban regions. These datasets provide high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations and are available at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nThese datasets were selected based on their relevance to carbon emissions in North America, their spatial and temporal coverage, and their availability in or potential to be converted into XLSX format for easier analysis.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific data or need further clarification, please let me know. For instance, if you have a preferred geographical granularity within North America or a specific sector's carbon emissions you're interested in (e.g., industrial, residential), providing that information could help narrow down the search."
