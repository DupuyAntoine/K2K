      "text": "I've searched for datasets related to sea surface height anomalies in North America between 2010 and 2020. Unfortunately, none of the retrieved datasets precisely match your request for CSV format and the specified time period. However, I can suggest some relevant datasets that might be useful for your research:\n\n1. **Sea Surface Height**: This dataset provides monthly and annual summaries of global sea surface height anomalies. Although it's not limited to North America, it does cover the region and is available from 1992 to 2016. The data is in a zip file and can be downloaded from [https://marinecadastre.gov/downloads/data/mc/SeaSurfaceHeight.zip](https://marinecadastre.gov/downloads/data/mc/SeaSurfaceHeight.zip).\n2. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**: This dataset offers global sea surface height anomalies from altimetry data, starting from 2017. It's available in various formats, including netCDF, which can be converted to CSV. You can access it through [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html).\n3. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: This dataset contains gridded sea surface height anomalies on a 1/6th degree grid every 5 days, derived from various altimeter missions. While it doesn't exactly match your time period, it's a valuable resource for understanding sea surface height anomalies globally. The data can be found at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\nTo better assist you, could you please specify if you're looking for a particular dataset or source for sea surface height anomalies in North America? Are there any specific requirements for the resolution or frequency of the data you're interested in? This information will help me provide more targeted suggestions."

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction.
