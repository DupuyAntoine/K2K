      "text": "Based on your request for XLSX datasets related to deforestation areas in South America between 2000 and 2010, I've searched through our database to find relevant datasets. Unfortunately, the exact match for XLSX format within the specified timeframe is not readily available in the retrieved results. However, I can provide you with information on several datasets that might be useful for your research, even if they don't perfectly match your format or timeframe criteria.\n\n1. **CMS: Estimated Deforested Area Biomass, Tropical America, Africa, and Asia, 2000**: This dataset provides estimates of pre-deforestation aboveground live woody biomass at 30-m resolution for deforested areas. Although it focuses on the year 2000 and includes tropical America (part of South America), it does not cover the full range of 2000-2010.\n\n2. **LBA-ECO LC-22 Field Validation of MODIS Deforestation Detection, Brazil, 2003-2004 and 2005**: These datasets contain field observations and corresponding GPS points for deforested areas in Mato Grosso, Brazil, which can be relevant for understanding deforestation patterns in part of South America during the early 2000s.\n\n3. **LBA-ECO LC-14 Modeled Deforestation Scenarios, Amazon Basin: 2002-2050**: This dataset models future deforestation scenarios across the Amazon Basin from 2002 to 2050, providing insights into potential deforestation trends over time, though it extends beyond your specified end date.\n\nEach of these datasets was selected because it pertains to deforestation in South America or specifically in Brazil (which is a significant part of the South American continent affected by deforestation) during or around the requested timeframe. They offer valuable information on deforestation patterns, biomass estimates, and modeled scenarios, which could be useful for understanding the scale and impact of deforestation in the region.\n\nFor more precise data matching your request (XLSX format, South America, 2000-2010), I would recommend checking directly with data providers such as the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) or international databases like those from NASA or the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, as they regularly update their datasets and might have more specific data available.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with accessing these datasets, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help."

The biomass estimates are only for areas where deforestation occurred during the period 2000 through 2012. These estimates represent biomass loss over this time period and can be used to derive average annual carbon emissions from tropical deforestation.",

The Global Forest Change data set defines trees as all vegetation taller than 5m in height. Forest loss (deforestation) is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. The data on forest loss were aggregated to a one kilometer resolution and subsetted to 200 kilometers from the coast to produce this data set. Raster values represent the percentage of the grid cell area that experienced forest cover loss from 2000 to 2012.",

This larger defined Amazon Basin (PanAmazon area) includes the Amazon River watershed, the Legal Amazon in Brazil, and the Guiana region. The model SimAmazonia was used to simulate monthly deforestation in the Amazon Basin from 2002 to 2050 for two scenarios: (1) a \"Business-as-Usual\" scenario, which considered the deforestation trends across the basin and projected the rates by using historical images and their variations from 1997 to 2002 and then added to that the effect of paving a set of major roads, and (2) a \"Governance\" scenario, that also considered the current deforestation trends, but assumed a 50% limit  imposed for deforested land within each basin's subregion, and that existing and proposed Protected Areas (PAs), play a decisive role in limiting deforestation as well (Soares et al., 2006).The provided data products include one GeoTiff (*.tif) for each year (2002 to 2050) for both model scenarios for a total of 98 files.

Data are provided in ESRI shapefile format. There are five compressed (*.zip) data files with this data set. Each shapefile represents one year of post-deforestation land use. Land use in the years following deforestation was estimated using annual time series of MODIS NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index). Metrics of vegetation phenology derived annual time series of MODIS NDVI and EVI data were analyzed using a decision-tree classifier to characterize the major cover type in each area of new deforestation. Post-deforestation land use for each large deforestation event was classified based on the classification of MODIS phenology metrics for all years following deforestation during 2002-2005.",

      "description": "This data set provides estimates of watershed deforestation, as a proportion of the total area of watersheds, in Rondonia, Brazil for 1999. Deforestation maps were determined for the main agricultural and surrounding forested areas of Rondonia using multiple Landsat TM scenes (Biggs et al. 2008). Cumulative deforestation estimates were derived from this time series of Landsat scenes from 1975 to 1999. To obtain watershed-level estimates of deforestation, watershed boundaries and stream networks were delineated by a flow accumulation algorithm using a 90-m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The results were watersheds of seven Strahler stream orders (1-7) with stream networks that closely matched those of the 1:100,000 topographic maps for the area. The watershed boundaries, classified by stream order, were overlain on the time series of deforestation maps to determine the cumulative deforestation extent in 1999. This data set contains six ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles of the watershed boundaries for streams orders 2-7, the smallest watershed (second order) to the largest inclusive watershed (seventh order). The cumulative deforestation estimates, as a proportion of total area for each watershed, are available as a comma-delimited text file that can be related to the individual watershed boundary shapefiles. Cumulative deforestation data are available for first order streams, although not as a shapefile. There are six zipped ESRI ArcGIS shapefiles (*.zip) and one ASCII comma separated file with this data set.",

      "description": "We combined a detailed field study of canopy gap fraction with spectral mixture analysis of Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery to assess landscape and regional dynamics of canopy damage following selective logging in an eastern Amazon forest.  Our field studies encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along multi-temporal sequences of post-harvest regrowth of 0.5-3.5 yr.  Areas used to stage harvested logs prior to transport, called log decks, had the largest forest gap fractions, but their contribution to the landscape-level gap dynamics was minor.  Tree falls were spatially the most extensive form of canopy damage following selective logging, but the canopy gap fractions resulting from them were small.  Reduced-impact logging resulted in consistently less damage to the forest canopy than did conventional logging practices.  This was true at the level of individual landscape strata such as roads, skids, and tree falls as well as at the area-integrated scale.A spectral mixture model was employed that utilizes bundles of field and image spectral reflectance measurements with a Monte Carlo analysis to estimate high spatial resolution (sub-pixel) cover of forest canopies, exposed non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soils in the Landsat imagery.  The method proved highly useful for quantifying forest canopy cover fraction in the log decks, roads, skids, tree fall, and intact forest areas, and it tracked canopy damage up to 3.5 yr post-harvest.  Forest canopy cover fractions derived from satellite observations were highly and inversely correlated with field- and satellite-based measurements.  A 450-km^2 study of gap fraction showed that approximately one-half of the canopy opening caused by logging is closed within one year of regrowth following timber harvests.  This is the first regional-scale study utilizing field measurements, satellite observations, and models to quantify forest canopy damage and recovery following selective logging in the Amazon.",
