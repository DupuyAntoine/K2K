      "text": "I've searched for datasets matching your request for sea surface height anomalies in North America between 2010 and 2020 in XLSX format. While the exact match is not available, I found some relevant datasets that might interest you:\n\n1. **Sea Surface Height**: This dataset contains monthly and annual summaries of global sea surface height anomalies. Although it's not limited to North America, it covers the region and spans from 1992 to 2016. The data is available in a ZIP file, which includes raw data that can be filtered for the North American region and the specified time frame. You can find it at [https://marinecadastre.gov/downloads/data/mc/SeaSurfaceHeight.zip](https://marinecadastre.gov/downloads/data/mc/SeaSurfaceHeight.zip).\n\n2. **NOAA CoastWatch, Sea Surface Height Anomalies from Altimetry, Global, 2017-present, EXPERIMENTAL**: This dataset provides daily sea surface height anomalies globally, including North America, from 2017 onwards. It's available in a gridded format, which can be downloaded from [https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/nesdisSSH1day.html). Note that this dataset starts from 2017, so it partially covers your requested time frame.\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies Version 2205**: This dataset offers gridded sea surface height anomalies on a global scale, including North America, from 1993 onwards. The data is updated regularly and can be accessed at [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC). While not exclusively in XLSX format, the data can be manipulated and extracted for the desired region and time frame.\n\nTo get datasets specifically in XLSX format or more precisely tailored to your request, you might need to manipulate the data from these sources or look into further processing the provided datasets. Alternatively, checking with specific data providers like NOAA or NASA for custom or more recent datasets could yield more precise results.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further assistance or have any follow-up questions!"

      "description": "These data are near-real-time (NRT) (within 7-9 hours of measurement) sea surface height anomalies (SSHA) from the AltiKa altimeter onboard the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL).  SARAL is a French(CNES)/Indian(SARAL) collaborative mission to measure sea surface height using the Ka-band AltiKa altimeter and was launched February 25, 2013. The major difference between these data and the Operational Geophysical Data Record (OGDR) data produced by the project is that the orbit from SARAL has been adjusted using SSHA differences with those from the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product at inter-satellite crossover locations. This produces a more accurate NRT orbit altitude for SARAL with accuracy of 1.5 cm (RMS), taking advantage of the 1 cm (radial RMS) accuracy of the GPS-based orbit used for the OSTM/Jason-2 GPS-OGDR-SSHA product. This dataset also contains all data from the project (reduced) OGDR, and improved altimeter wind speeds and sea state bias correction. More information on the SARAL mission can be found at: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/missions/current-missions/saral.html",
