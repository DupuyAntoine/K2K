      "text": "Based on your request for XLS datasets of land surface albedo in South America between 2000 and 2010, I have searched through various datasets to find relevant matches. Unfortunately, the search results did not yield datasets that perfectly match your criteria, specifically for South America and in XLS format. However, I can provide you with some related datasets that might be useful for your research:\n\n1. **Surface Spectral Albedo**: This dataset, although not specific to South America, provides information on surface albedo and can be found at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::surfspecalb1mlawer](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::surfspecalb1mlawer). It might be useful to explore if it covers any parts of South America or if similar datasets are available for the region.\n\n2. **NLCD - MODIS land cover-albedo dataset for the continental United States**: While this dataset is focused on the United States, it demonstrates the integration of land cover and albedo data, which could be a model for what you're looking for in South America. It can be accessed through [https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=A-3txd-117](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=A-3txd-117) and [https://www.mrlc.gov/data](https://www.mrlc.gov/data).\n\n3. **NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 2 Land Surface Albedo (LSA)**: This dataset provides land surface albedo data but is not limited to South America. It's available at [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01535/html](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01535/html).\n\nTo find datasets more closely matching your needs, I suggest specifying the country or region within South America you're interested in, as well as considering other formats that might be convertible to XLS. Additionally, checking with data providers like NASA, NOAA, or regional environmental agencies might yield more targeted results.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or need further assistance in searching for these datasets, please let me know."

      "description": "The objective of this study was to determine the spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo as related to the ground cover and under a range of solar conditions during the Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) at the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico on May 20-30, 1997. The surface albedo was sampled as described in Barnsley et al. (2000) at intervals along transects radiating north, south, east, and west from the main instrumentation tower at the transitional vegetation site. Several of these transects were sampled on more than one occasion, under a range of solar illumination conditions. At the grassland site, albedo measurements were taken along a single transect, sampled at 10-m intervals, at three different times of day (i.e., at different solar zenith angles). In addition to the albedo data, hemispherical photographs were taken at each of the sample sites to provide a visual record, and the images were classified to estimate the proportion of bare soil, live vegetation, and woody ground cover.",

Water vapor is included to assist with evaluating the accuracy of the IST data and the model output. Also included is an ice mask and a basins mask for delineating drainage basins in Greenland.\n\nSurface temperature is a fundamental input for dynamical ice sheet models because it is a component of the ice sheet radiation budget and mass balance. Surface temperature also influences ice sheet processes, such as surface melt. This data set may be used as a resource for model-validation studies such as comparing MERRA-2 surface temperature with MODIS IST, and for comparing MODIS IST, albedo and water vapor with products from sensors on other satellites such as VIIRS and AIRS\n\nThe temporal coverage for this data set spans 1 March 2000 through 31 December 2019, with the exception of the IST data, which has been extended through 31 Aug 2021.",

The LSA is a shortwave broadband blue-sky albedo over wavelengths between 0.4 and 3.0 Âµm. Besides the blue-sky broadband shortwave albedo, the LSA algorithm also generates spectral land surface reflectance as byproducts. The frequent temporal refreshment, fine spectral resolution and large spatial coverage make ABI a unique data source for mapping LSA. The Land Surface Albedo product image is provided at 2 km resolution on the ABI fixed grid for Full Disk, CONUS, and Mesoscale coverage regions from GOES East and West.",
