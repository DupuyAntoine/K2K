      "text": "Based on your request for GEOJSON datasets of ice cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean between 2010 and 2020, I've searched through various datasets that might match your criteria. \n\nUnfortunately, none of the datasets I found perfectly match your request for ice cover extent specifically in the Atlantic Ocean, in GEOJSON format, and covering the 2010-2020 period. However, I can suggest some alternatives and similar datasets that might be of interest:\n\n1. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: This dataset, available from NOAA, provides weekly snow cover and sea ice extent for the Northern Hemisphere, which includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean, from 1966 through 2023. It's not exclusively focused on the Atlantic, but it does cover a broad area and could be useful for understanding larger trends.\n\n2. **Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent - Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-NH)**: Provided by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), this dataset includes daily sea ice extent and edge boundary for the Northern Hemisphere, which can be relevant for studying the Atlantic's ice cover. It's available in ASCII text files and as image files but not directly in GEOJSON.\n\n3. **Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration, 1850 Onward**: Another dataset from NSIDC, this one offers historical monthly gridded sea ice concentration from 1850, switching to satellite passive microwave data in 1979. It's not limited to the Atlantic Ocean but provides comprehensive global data that might help in analyzing long-term trends.\n\nTo refine your search or find more specific datasets, it would be helpful to know if there's a particular aspect of ice cover extent you're interested in (e.g., specific regions within the Atlantic, certain times of the year). Additionally, considering the limitations in the exact matching datasets, looking into datasets that might require some processing to extract the Atlantic Ocean region could be a viable alternative.\n\nFor direct downloads and more detailed information, please visit the following links:\n- Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html\n- Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent - Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-NH): https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02186/\n- Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration, 1850 Onward: https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10010_V2/\n\nIf you have any follow-up questions or need further assistance in refining your search, please don't hesitate to ask."

      "description": "This dataset is a single polyline file that depicts the boundary of the Little Ice Age maximum advance of the terminus of Exit and Paradise Glaciers. The data were collected and digitized for the purpose of identifying, as nearly as possible, the maximum extent of the Little Ice Age (1800s) expansion of the terminal margin of Exit Glacier and Paradise Glacier. Fragments of moraines previously dated by other investigators capture only a small portion of the boundary of that glacier expansion, so this dataset was developed to provide a complete map of the LIA maximum boundary, without requiring definitive dating of any particular portion of the boundary. It is assumed that the entire mapped boundary was occupied by glacier ice sometime during the LIA maximum (nominally 1815-1899 A.D.), but within that time range some portions of the glacier may have reached their maximum extents before or after others.",

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",
