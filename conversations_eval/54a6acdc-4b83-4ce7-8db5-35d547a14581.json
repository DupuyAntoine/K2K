      "text": "Based on your query for GEOJSON datasets of aerosol optical depth in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000, I have conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the exact match for your criteria, specifically datasets in GEOJSON format covering aerosol optical depth over Antarctica for the period 1990-2000, is not readily available in the retrieved files.\n\nHowever, several datasets related to aerosol optical depth have been identified, which might be of interest or could be adapted to your needs. These include:\n\n1. **NIMFR: derived total & aerosol optical depth from 1st Michalsky algorithm** - This dataset, while not specifically in GEOJSON format, provides information on aerosol optical depth. It can be accessed through the [ARM Archive](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::nimfraod1mich).\n\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths** and **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, NIR Aerosol Optical Depths** - These datasets from the ARM Climate Research Facility offer aerosol optical depth measurements, albeit not directly in GEOJSON format. They are available at the [ARM Archive](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sashevisaod) and [ARM Archive](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::sasheniraod), respectively.\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001** - Although focused on High Mountain Asia and not Antarctica, this dataset contains aerosol optical depth data from MODIS sensors. It might be useful for understanding aerosol optical depth measurements or for comparative studies. The dataset can be found on [NASA's Earthdata](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FD0SO1YA0B9EY).\n\n4. **MODIS/Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, **MODIS/Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, and **MODIS/Terra+Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT** - These near-real-time datasets from MODIS provide global aerosol optical depth measurements. While they are not limited to Antarctica and not in GEOJSON format, they could be valuable for aerosol studies. Access to these datasets is through [NASA's Earthdata](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt).\n\nFor your specific request, it seems there might be a gap in available datasets that exactly match your criteria, particularly in terms of geographical focus (Antarctica), time period (1990-2000), and data format (GEOJSON). To proceed, you might consider:\n\n- Contacting data providers directly to inquire about potential datasets or the possibility of converting existing data into GEOJSON format.\n- Exploring datasets that cover broader geographical areas or slightly different time frames, which might still be useful for your research or analysis.\n- Utilizing tools or services that can convert existing dataset formats into GEOJSON, if the primary data of interest is available in another format.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any way I can assist further, such as helping with the conversion process or providing more information on the datasets mentioned."

Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
