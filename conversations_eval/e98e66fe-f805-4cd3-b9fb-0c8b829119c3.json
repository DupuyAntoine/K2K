      "text": "You are looking for datasets related to surface temperature anomalies in France, specifically for the period between 1980 and 1990, and you need the data in CSV format. \n\nAfter conducting a search, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your query, although none directly match your specific criteria for France between 1980 and 1990 in CSV format. Here are a few datasets that could be useful, along with a brief description of what each contains and why they were selected:\n\n1. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - HadCRUT3 global surface temperature anomalies since 1850**: This dataset provides global surface temperature anomalies and could be relevant for understanding broader temperature trends that might affect France. It's available from the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\n2. **GISS Surface Temperature Analysis**: Offered by NASA, this dataset includes global 2x2 gridded temperature anomaly data. While it's not limited to France, it could be used to extract data relevant to your query.\n\n3. **Sea Surface Temperature (SST) datasets from various sources**: Several datasets related to sea surface temperature anomalies were found, which could be useful if your interest extends to coastal areas of France or if you're considering the impact of sea surface temperatures on land temperatures.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these datasets are specifically for France between 1980 and 1990 in CSV format. To better assist you, I would like to clarify a few points:\n- Are you looking for a specific dataset or source for the surface temperature anomalies in France? \n- Would you like the data from a particular organization or agency, such as NASA or the European Space Agency?\n\nIf you're open to exploring alternatives or have more specific details about what you're looking for, please let me know, and I'll do my best to help."

The temperature is calculated using the Emissivity Normalization Algorithm that separate temperature from emissivity. The incoming solar radiation was calculated using spatial based insolation model developed by Fu and Rich (1999). Then the temperature due to solar radiation was calculated using emissivity derived from ASTER data. The residual temperature, i.e. temperature due to solar radiation subtracted from ASTER temperature was used to identify thermally anomalous areas. Areas that had temperature greater than 2o were considered ASTER modeled \"very warm modeled surface temperature\" are shown in red on the map.
