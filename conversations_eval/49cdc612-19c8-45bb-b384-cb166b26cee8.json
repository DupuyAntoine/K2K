      "text": "You are looking for Evapotranspiration data specifically over North Africa, covering the period from 2003 to 2015. Unfortunately, the provided datasets do not exactly match your request, as they are either from different regions or do not cover the specified time frame. However, I can suggest some alternatives and provide information on datasets that might be useful for your research, even if they don't perfectly align with your initial request.\n\nThe datasets I've retrieved are mainly from the United States and cover various aspects of evapotranspiration, such as reference evapotranspiration, evaporative fraction, and actual evapotranspiration, primarily in the context of the United States. For instance, the \"Operational Global Actual Evapotranspiration using the SSEBop model\" and \"Daily SSEBop Evapotranspiration Data from 2000 to Present\" could be of interest, although they are not limited to North Africa.\n\nTo better assist you, I would need more specific information about the type of Evapotranspiration data you are looking for (e.g., daily, monthly averages) and the desired format (e.g., CSV, NetCDF). Additionally, knowing if there's a particular producer or dataset you're interested in could help narrow down the search.\n\nFor now, here are a few datasets that might be of general interest, though they don't match your geographical and temporal criteria:\n1. **Operational Global Actual Evapotranspiration using the SSEBop model** - This dataset provides global actual evapotranspiration estimates. While not specific to North Africa, it could be useful for broader research.\n2. **Daily SSEBop Evapotranspiration Data from 2000 to Present** - Offers daily evapotranspiration data, which might be adaptable for studies in North Africa, though it's focused on the CONUS.\n3. **Russian River Integrated Hydrologic Model (RRIHM): Reference Evapotranspiration** - Although specific to the Russian River Watershed, it demonstrates the kind of detailed evapotranspiration data that might be available for other regions.\n\nTo proceed, could you please provide more details about your specific needs, such as the desired data format and any particular dataset or producer you're interested in? This will help in narrowing down the search to find the most relevant data for your research on Evapotranspiration over North Africa from 2003 to 2015."

      "description": "The Russian River Watershed (RRW) covers about 1,300 square miles (without Santa Rosa Plain) of urban, agricultural, and forested lands in northern Sonoma County and southern Mendocino County, California. Communities in the RRW depend on a combination of Russian River water and groundwater to meet their water-supply demands. Water is used primarily for agricultural irrigation, municipal and private wells supply, and commercial uses - such as for wineries and recreation. Annual rainfall in the RRW is highly variable, making it prone to droughts and flooding from atmospheric river events. In order to better understand surface-water and groundwater issues, the USGS is creating a Coupled Ground-Water and Surface-Water Flow Model (GSFLOW; Markstrom and others, 2008) of the RRW. This model will include climate, geology, surface-water, groundwater, and land-use data.\nThese data are the daily reference evapotranspiration values for two stations in the Russian River watershed for 1910-2017.",

Each of the 15 images used in this study had three corresponding Tif files representing ETf, ETo, and ETa. Data used in this project was sourced from Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1 images processed in Google Earth Engine (GEE). These images contain five visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands and two short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance, and two thermal infrared (TIR) bands processed to orthorectified brightness temperature. To determine thermal properties of images to aid in ET calculation, the TIR Band 10 (B10) containing brightness temperature was chosen to determine Land Surface Temperature (LST).",

      "description": "With increasing population growth and land-use change, urban communities in the desert southwest are progressively \nlooking to remote basins to supplement existing water supplies.  Recent applications for groundwater appropriations \nfrom Dixie Valley, Nevada, a primarily undeveloped basin neighboring the Carson Desert to the east, have prompted \na reevaluation of the quantity of naturally discharging groundwater. The objective of this study was to develop a new, \nindependent estimate of groundwater discharge by evapotranspiration (ET) from Dixie Valley using a combination of \neddy-covariance evapotranspiration measurements and multispectral satellite imagery. Mean annual groundwater ET \n(ETg) was estimated during October 2009-2011 at four eddy covariance sites.  Two sites were located in phreatophytic \nshrubland dominated by greasewood and two were located on a playa.  Estimates were scaled to the basin level by \ncombining remotely sensed imagery with field reconnaissance and site-scale ETg estimates.  Vegetation index and \nbrightness temperature data were used to partition Dixie Valley into five discharging ET units, and scale actual and \npotential ETg to the basin level. ET units are spatially constrained by a groundwater discharge area which represents \nthe area where discharge from evaporation by open water or bare soil and transpiration from phreatophytic plants \nexceeds the volume of water contributed by precipitation. Each ET unit represents a generalized grouping of vegetation \nand soil conditions that were used as the basis of estimation of total ETg.  ET units were partitioned as: playa lake, \nplaya, sparse shrubland, moderate-to-dense shrubland, and grassland.",
