      "text": "I've conducted a search based on your request for aerosol optical depth data in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000 in CSV format. While I couldn't find exact matches that meet all your criteria, I've identified several datasets that might be relevant or useful for your needs.\n\n1. **NIMFR: Derived Total & Aerosol Optical Depth from 1st Michalsky Algorithm**: This dataset, available from the ARM Data Archive, provides aerosol optical depth measurements. Although it doesn't specifically mention Antarctica or the exact time frame, it's worth exploring as it deals with aerosol optical depths.\n\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, NIR Aerosol Optical Depths** and **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths**: These datasets from the ARM Data Archive offer aerosol optical depth measurements in the near-infrared and visible spectrum, respectively. Like the first option, they might not perfectly match your geographical or temporal requirements but are relevant to aerosol optical depth research.\n\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001**: This dataset, although focused on High Mountain Asia, provides monthly mean MODIS Level 3 data from aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) at a spatial resolution of 1º by 1º. It's a bit outside your specified region but could be useful for comparative studies or understanding global aerosol patterns.\n\n4. **Earth Observatory Aerosol Optical Depth**: This resource from NASA's Earth Observatory offers general information on aerosols, including their types, effects, and how aerosol optical depth is measured. While not a dataset per se, it's a valuable resource for understanding the context and importance of aerosol optical depth data.\n\n5. **MODIS/Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, **MODIS/Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**, and **MODIS/Terra+Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**: These near-real-time datasets from MODIS provide value-added aerosol optical depth products. They are designed for quantitative applications, including data assimilation and model validation, and are available for download through NASA's Earthdata portal.\n\nTo access these datasets, you can visit the following links:\n- For NIMFR and Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer datasets: http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/\n- For High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FD0SO1YA0B9EY\n- For Earth Observatory information: https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Aerosols\n- For MODIS datasets: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt\n\nIf these datasets do not precisely meet your requirements, it might be helpful to clarify or refine your search criteria, such as specifying a particular region within Antarctica or adjusting the time frame slightly. Additionally, considering datasets that might not be in CSV format but could be easily converted might expand your options."

      "description": "The NASA Ames Airborne Tracking 14-channel Sunphotometer (AATS-14) was operated successfully aboard the University of Washington CV-580 for 24 data flights during the dry-season airborne campaign from August 13 to September 25, 2000. Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
