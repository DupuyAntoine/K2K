      "text": "Based on your request, I've searched for XLSX datasets related to land surface albedo in South America between 2000 and 2010. Unfortunately, the search results didn't yield any datasets that exactly match your criteria. However, I found some relevant datasets that might be of interest to you:\n\n1. **NLCD - MODIS land cover-albedo dataset for the continental United States**: Although this dataset doesn't cover South America, it does provide land cover and albedo data for the continental United States between 2000 and 2010. The dataset is available in various formats, but not XLSX. You can find it at [https://www.mrlc.gov/data](https://www.mrlc.gov/data).\n2. **Multilayer Greenland Ice Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, and Water Vapor from MODIS V001**: This dataset contains surface albedo data, but it's focused on Greenland, not South America. It's available in various formats, including NetCDF, but not XLSX. You can find it at [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2F7THUWT9NMPDK](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2F7THUWT9NMPDK).\n3. **NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 2 Land Surface Albedo (LSA)**: This dataset provides land surface albedo data, but it's focused on the continental United States, and the format is NetCDF, not XLSX. You can find it at [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01535/html](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C01535/html).\n\nTo find more relevant datasets, I would need more information about the specific producer or source you're looking for. Alternatively, you could try searching for datasets on websites like the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earthdata portal.\n\nIf you have any further questions or would like to refine your search, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you."

      "description": "The objective of this study was to determine the spatial variations in field measurements of broadband albedo as related to the ground cover and under a range of solar conditions during the Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) at the Jornada Experimental Range in New Mexico on May 20-30, 1997. The surface albedo was sampled as described in Barnsley et al. (2000) at intervals along transects radiating north, south, east, and west from the main instrumentation tower at the transitional vegetation site. Several of these transects were sampled on more than one occasion, under a range of solar illumination conditions. At the grassland site, albedo measurements were taken along a single transect, sampled at 10-m intervals, at three different times of day (i.e., at different solar zenith angles). In addition to the albedo data, hemispherical photographs were taken at each of the sample sites to provide a visual record, and the images were classified to estimate the proportion of bare soil, live vegetation, and woody ground cover.",

Surface temperature also influences ice sheet processes, such as surface melt.

The LSA is a shortwave broadband blue-sky albedo over wavelengths between 0.4 and 3.0 Âµm. Besides the blue-sky broadband shortwave albedo, the LSA algorithm also generates spectral land surface reflectance as byproducts. The frequent temporal refreshment, fine spectral resolution and large spatial coverage make ABI a unique data source for mapping LSA. The Land Surface Albedo product image is provided at 2 km resolution on the ABI fixed grid for Full Disk, CONUS, and Mesoscale coverage regions from GOES East and West.",
