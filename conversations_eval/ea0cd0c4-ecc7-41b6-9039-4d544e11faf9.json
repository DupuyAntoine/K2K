      "text": "Based on your request for XLSX datasets related to land use change in the Pacific Ocean between 2000 and 2010, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the search results didn't yield datasets that exactly match your criteria, particularly in the XLSX format and focused on the Pacific Ocean. However, I found several datasets that involve land use and land cover change, which might be relevant or helpful for your research.\n\n1. **LCMAP Hawaii Reference Data Product land cover, land use and change process attributes**: This dataset, available in both CSV and XLSX formats, contains annual land cover, land use, and change process variables for Hawaii from 2000 to 2019. While it's not exclusively about the Pacific Ocean, it does cover a part of the region and could be useful for understanding land use changes in a specific context.\n\n2. **Historical Land-Cover Change and Land-Use Conversions Global Dataset**: This global dataset includes estimates of land-cover types and annual transformations of land use from 1770 to 2010. It's not limited to the Pacific Ocean but covers land use changes globally, which could be helpful for broader studies.\n\n3. **Land Use and Land Cover Change Projection in the ABoVE Domain**: Although focused on the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) domain and not directly on the Pacific Ocean, this dataset provides projections of land use and land cover change from 2015 to 2100. It might offer insights into future land use trends, albeit in a different geographic context.\n\nTo find datasets more specifically related to land use change in the Pacific Ocean between 2000 and 2010 in XLSX format, I recommend checking databases like the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, or the NASA Earthdata portal, which often host a wide range of environmental and land use datasets.\n\nIf you could provide more details about the specific region within the Pacific Ocean you're interested in or any particular type of land use change (e.g., deforestation, urbanization), I might be able to offer more targeted assistance or suggest alternative datasets that could meet your needs."

      "description": "A set of three estimates of land-cover types and annual transformations of land use are provided on a global 0.5 x0.5 degree lat/lon grid at annual time steps. The longest of the three estimates spans 1770-2010. The dataset presented here takes into account land-cover change due to four major land-use/management activities: (1) cropland expansion and abandonment, (2) pastureland expansion and abandonment, (3) urbanization, and (4) secondary forest regrowth due to wood harvest. Due to uncertainties associated with estimating historical agricultural (crops and pastures) land use, the study uses three widely accepted global reconstruction of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data set to provide three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying land-use conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and extent to which different ecosystem have undergone changes. The three estimates use a consistent methodology, and start with a common land-cover map during pre-industrial conditions (year 1765), taking different courses as determined by the land-use/management datasets (cropland, pastureland, urbanization and wood harvest) to attain forest area distributions close to satellite estimates of forests for contemporary period. The satellite based estimates of forest area are based on MODIS sensor. All data uses the WGS84 spatial coordinate system for mapping.",

      "description": "Modeled projections for deep decarbonization require large amounts of solar energy, which may compete with other land uses such as agriculture, urbanization, and conservation of natural lands. Existing capacity expansion models do not integrate land use land cover change (LULC) dynamics into projections. We explored the interaction between projected LULC and solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment by integrating projections of LULC with a model that can project future deployment of solar PV with high spatial resolution for the conterminous United States. We used four scenarios of LULC projections from 2010 to 2050 and two electricity grid scenarios to model future PV deployment and compare those results against a baseline that held 2010 land cover constant through 2050. Though solar PV’s overall technical potential was minimally impacted by LULC scenarios, deployed PV varied by -16.5 to 11.6% in 2050 from the baseline scenario. Land requirements for projected PV were similar to other studies, while measures of PV impacts on natural systems depended on the underlying land change dynamics occurring in a scenario. The solar PV deployed through 2050 resulted in 1.1%–2.4% of croplands and 0.3%–0.7% of natural lands being converted to PV. However, the deepest understanding of PV impacts and interactions with land cover emerge when the complete net gains and losses from all land cover change dynamics, including PV, are integrated. For example, one of the four LULC projections allows for large solar development and a net gain in natural lands, even though PV drives a larger percentage of natural land conversion. This paper represents an initial step in integrating land cover change dynamics with energy expansion models, suggesting it may be possible to capture bidirectional relationships between energy and other processes that require land.",

      "description": "Hydrologic indicator statistics were computed for 82 selected surface water sites located throughout Minnesota using daily streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS). The 187 hydrologic indicator statistics were computed in RStudio version 3.5.0 using the EflowStats version 5.0.0 (Mills and Blodgett, 2017) and NWCCompare version 5.0 (Blodgett, 2017). The computed hydrologic indicator statistics encompass the five components of hydrologic conditions: magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change. Magnitude is the amount of water moving past a fixed location in a given unit of time. Frequency refers to how often streamflows above a given magnitude recur over a specified time interval. Duration is the period of time associated with a specific streamflow condition. Timing refers to the regularity with which streamflows of a given magnitude occur, and rate of change refers to how quickly the magnitude of streamflow changes (Poff and others, 1997). Site selection was based on sites previously selected in three other studies evaluating long-term streamflow records for trends (Novatny and Stefan, 2007; Peterson, Nieber, and Kanivetsky, 2011; Ziegeweid et.al, 2015). Nontrend sites were shown to not have trends in streamflow that were not related to precipitation. Hydrologic indicator statistics were computed for two periods: 1) the pre-period from 10-1-1944 through 9-30-1979 and 2) the post-period from 10-1-1980 through 9-30-2015. Exact dates of the start of trends varied among sites, but 1980 was the selected cutoff period based on an approximation of the largest cluster and on other anecdotal evidence of changes in farming practices. Both categories also had at least 10 water years with complete streamflow data. \nBlodgett, D., 2017, NWCCompare: Returns NWC comparison stats for two daily data sets version 5.0, https://github.com/USGS-R/NWCCompare. \nMills, J., and Blodgett, D., 2017, EflowStats: Hydrologic Indicator and Alterations Stats version 5.0.0, https://github.com/USGS-R/EflowStats. \nNovotny, E.V., and Stefan, H.G., 2007, Stream flow in Minnesota: Indicator of climate change, Journal of Hydrology 334: 319-333. \nPeterson, H.M., Nieber, J.L., and Kanivetsky, R., 2011, Hydrologic regionalization to assess anthropogenic changes, Journal of Hydrology 408: 212-225. \nZiegeweid, J.R., Lorenz, D.L., Sanocki, C.A., and Czuba, C.R., 2015, Methods for estimating flow-duration curve and low-flow frequency statistics for ungaged locations on small streams in Minnesota: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015–5170, 23 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20155170.",

      "description": "To support coordinated conservation, wetland restoration, and climate adaptation planning, we have developed five future scenarios of the Central Valley's seasonally flooded cropland and wetland waterbird habitat based on the State’s most recent climate and land use projections (Wilson et al. 2021).The USGS Western Geographic Science Center and Point Blue Conservation Science modeled a Business-as-Usual scenario plus the four scenarios developed for the Central Valley Landscape Conservation Project, which diverged along two key themes: water availability and management for conservation. Scenarios varied by climate projection (hot and wet vs. warm and dry) and management priorities (wetland restoration rate, crop conversion rate, and prioritization of water for wetland and cropland habitats). Urbanization rates were the same for all scenarios. To model these scenarios, we integrated a hydrologic and water-use model (the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model, WEAP-CVwh, Matchett and Fleskes, 2017) with a land change model (the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator, LUCAS, Wilson et al. 2020). The models produced annual maps of land use change and monthly maps of flooded habitat probability at 270-meter resolution, from 2011 to 2101 (Wilson et al. 2021). The scenarios were:\nHistorical Business As Usual (HBAU) = historical water availability, historical management\nCalifornia Dreamin' (DREAM) = high water, good management\nBad Business As Usual (BBAU) = high water, poor management\nEveryone Equally Miserable (EEM) = low water, good management\nCentral Valley Dustbowl (DUST) = low water, poor management\nThis data release contains three types of model output tabular summaries for four geographic areas: WEAP model zones, Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) California Bulletin 118 groundwater sub-basins, Central Valley Joint Venture (CVJV) planning basins, and Central Valley regions. The datasets summarize 1) land use change for select land use/land cover classes, 2) area of likely flooded habitat, and 3) change in January flooded habitat area and its causes for the 5 future scenarios of managed waterbird habitat. The datasets were generated from the LUCAS model and the WEAP CVwh model as described in the parent manuscript. The full methods and results of this research are described in detail in the parent manuscript \"Integrated modeling of climate and land change impacts on future dynamic wetland habitat – a case study from California’s Central Valley\" (2021).
