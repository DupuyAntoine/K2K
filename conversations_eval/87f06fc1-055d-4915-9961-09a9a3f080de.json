      "text": "Based on your request for JSON datasets of river discharge in Africa between 2015 and 2023, I've searched through our database to find relevant datasets that match your criteria. Unfortunately, the search results did not yield any datasets that exactly match your specifications, including the JSON format and the specific time frame.\n\nHowever, I found several datasets related to river discharge that might be of interest to you, although they may not perfectly align with your requirements. These datasets are primarily in ASCII or netCDF format, which might still be useful depending on your analysis tools and capabilities.\n\n1. **SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: This dataset is a subset of the CPEP Global River Discharge Data Set and includes monthly mean discharge data for southern Africa. It's available in ASCII format.\n\n2. **Global River Discharge, 1807-1991, V[ersion]. 1.1 (RivDIS)**: Although this dataset covers a broader time period (1807-1991) and the entire world, it includes data for African rivers and might be useful for historical context or comparative studies. The data is derived from UNESCO archives and is checked against information from the Global Runoff Center.\n\n3. **SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products Version 1**: This dataset, from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, provides estimates of river discharge, including both unconstrained and gauge-constrained estimates. It's a global dataset available in netCDF format, which might require additional processing to extract African river discharge data.\n\nTo access these datasets, please follow these links:\n- SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=river_discharge_cpep_640&ac=true\n- Global River Discharge: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=rivdis_199&ac=true\n- SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products: https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC\n\nIf you're unable to find a suitable dataset or require more precise data (e.g., specific rivers, exact time frames, or the JSON format), I recommend checking with data providers directly or exploring other databases that specialize in hydrological data, such as the UNESCO Institute for Water Education or national hydrological services. Additionally, you might consider converting available datasets from their original formats to JSON if that's a strict requirement for your analysis.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any further assistance I can provide or if you have any follow-up questions!"

These surveys were collected using a real time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) and an echo sounder mounted on a motorboat and also behind a kayak at various cross sections and longitudinal profiles along the river. These datasets were collected in support of a funded effort investigating the cause of salt water intrusion that has taken place at the water intake facility for Harbor City, Oregon. The surveys were collected at sections approximately 0.4 river miles downstream to 0.8 river miles upstream of the Harbor City water intake structure and also at the city of Brookings water intake facility, located approximately 1.6 river miles upstream of the Harbor City intake structure.",

The SWOT mission is implemented jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.Sword of Science data products are generated from the open-source SWOT Confluence program and contain river discharge parameter estimates as well as discharge time series for both river reaches and river nodes, following the SWOT River Database (SWORD) structure. Granules from both constrained and unconstrained branches are composed of prior information (e.g., mean annual flow predicted by global hydrological models) and the resulting discharge estimates. Priors and results files for both constrained and unconstrained branches are available in netCDF format. Users are encouraged to reference the SWOT Confluence documentation and notebook tutorials for full documentation of the data structure and variables available.Development of the SWOT Confluence program as well as the Sword of Science data products was funded by NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program.",

The data were compiled from RivDIS Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy.
