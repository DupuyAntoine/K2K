      "text": "You're looking for chlorophyll concentration data in the Mediterranean Area for summer 2018. I've searched through various datasets to find relevant information for you.\n\nAlthough I couldn't find an exact match with all the specifics you're looking for, I did find some datasets related to chlorophyll concentrations in different regions and time frames. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **Matched Sentinel-2 spectral data and chlorophyll a concentrations 2015-2020**: This dataset includes Sentinel-2 spectral data matched with chlorophyll a concentration data from several sources, including the Water Quality Portal. While it's not limited to the Mediterranean Area or summer 2018, it does cover a broader period and area that might be useful. You can find it at https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1529420/S2_chla_matchups.xlsx.\n\n2. **Concentration of chlorophyll a derived from ocean color remote sensing**: This dataset provides chlorophyll a concentrations derived from ocean color remote sensing. It's a more general dataset but relevant to your interest in chlorophyll concentrations. The data can be accessed at https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/nmfs_odp_nefsc/PARR/READ/EDAB/27408.\n\n3. **Indicators of Coastal Water Quality: Change in Chlorophyll-a Concentration 1998-2007**: This dataset includes tabular time series of chlorophyll-a concentrations for grid cells, derived from NASA's Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Although it's focused on change over a decade rather than a specific summer, it could offer insights into broader trends. More information is available at https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.7927%2FH48W3B88.\n\nTo better assist you, could you please clarify what format you would prefer the data in (e.g., CSV, JSON) and if you're looking for data from a specific producer or source (e.g., satellite, in-situ measurements)? This information will help narrow down the search to provide more targeted results."

Chlorophyll-a concentrations are derived from NASA's Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). The grid cells are organized by country, and the percentage of change from 1998-2007 is calculated for each cell. Each time series was assessed with a linear regression, and cells with statistically significant trends in chlorophyll-a concentrations are identified. The rows of the table are linked to a sequence grid from the \"Indicators of Coastal Water Quality: Ancillary Data\" collection to facilitate the mapping of the trend values for selected countries and areas of interest. The data are processed and compiled by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",

      "description": "The Annual Chlorophyll-a Concentrations component of the Indicators of Coastal Water Quality Collection consists of gridded satellite measurements of chlorophyll-a concentrations (in nanogram/cubic meter) in a band extending between 10 and 100 km from the shoreline. Chlorophyll-a concentrations are derived from NASA's Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). The grids are based on annual composites of SeaWiFS satellite data provided by the SeaWiFS Project, NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and GeoEye in the form of HDF files at a resolution of 5 arc-minutes (approximately 9 x 9 km at the equator). The source files are true-color images generated from sub-sampled, calibrated, Rayleigh-corrected level-2 data, which are derived from raw radiance counts by applying sensor calibration, atmospheric corrections, and bio-optical algorithms. To arrive at chlorophyll-a concentrations, radiance counts were converted using the conversion formula provided as part of the original data files. The gridding is done by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).",
