      "description": "The files in this data set contain monthly mean landfast sea ice data gathered from both Russian Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) and Canadian Ice Service (CIS) sources. Data are in the form of percent of area covered, within a longitude-latitude grid with 0.2° resolution. Details on processing and treatment are given in the contributor's PhD thesis (König, 2007). The data are provided in NetCDF format. The time span over which data are available is split into three ranges: for 1953-1967 there are only AARI data, for 1968-1990 both AARI and CIS data are available, and from 1991-1998 only CIS data are available. There are a total of six files: two for the 1953-1967 data, two for the 1968-1990 data, and two for the 1991-1998 data. There are two files for each range because the files with \"_noNaN\" in their names contain \"-1000\" as the missing value, and the other files use \"nan\" as the missing value. Otherwise, the data in those files are identical. König obtained AARI data from NSIDC data set AARI 10-Day Arctic Ocean EASE-Grid Sea Ice Observations. NSIDC has replaced that data set with Sea Ice Charts of the Russian Arctic in Gridded Format, 1933-2006 (AARI, 2007). That data set was edited and compiled by V. Smolyanitsky, V. Borodachev, A. Mahoney, F. Fetterer, and R. Barry (https://nsidc.org/data/g02176).Notice to Data Users: The documentation for this data set was provided solely by the contributor, Christof S. König, and was not further developed, thoroughly reviewed, or edited by NSIDC. Thus, support for this data set may be limited.",

      "description": "This data set provides sea ice extent for the Arctic (60-90 degrees North) and Antarctic (52-90 degrees South) in Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) binary image format, along with ASCII text files containing latitude and longitude coordinates along the sea ice edge, and browse images of SIR files in Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) format. Ancillary products include daily-averaged total sea ice extent in ASCII format. Estimates of sea ice extent were produced from daily-averaged QuikSCAT sigma-0 measurements and extend from 19 July 1999 to 31 December 2009.QuikSCAT obtains 12 individual radar normalized backscatter (sigma-0) measurements, called slices, for each footprint as it scans over a 1800 km wide swath. Slices are typically 4 to 6 km long by 20 km wide. The summed measurements of the slices are called egg measurements. The effective resolution and shape of each egg measurement is approximately 20 by 30 km, depending on the antenna beam and instrument mode. This data set contains both slice and egg images for each day.The Microwave Earth Remote Sensing (MERS) group at Brigham Young University (BYU) developed a SIR-with-filtering (SIRF) algorithm that combines forward- and aft-looking sigma-0 measurements to produce enhanced-resolution backscatter images over various azimuth angles. The polarization ratio, incidence angle dependence, and the sigma-0 estimate error standard deviation were used to discriminate between sea ice and ocean. Sea ice extent was estimated for both slice and egg images. The nominal pixel resolution of the slice images is 2.225 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 4 km. Egg images have a nominal pixel resolution of 4.45 km with an estimated effective resolution of approximately 8 to 10 km.Data and browse images are available via FTP, along with C, Fortran, and Interactive Data Language (IDL) tools to read and display the SIR images.",
