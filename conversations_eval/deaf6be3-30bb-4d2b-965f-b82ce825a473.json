      "text": "Based on your request for ozone concentration data over the United States in 2020, I have found several datasets that may be relevant to your query. Here's a summary of what I found:\n\n1. **Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) Hourly Ozone Concentrations**: This dataset, provided by the EPA, contains hourly ozone concentrations measured at over 80 CASTNET sites across the United States. The data includes site location information and is available for download in a zip file from [https://gaftp.epa.gov/Castnet/CASTNET_Outgoing/data/ozone.zip](https://gaftp.epa.gov/Castnet/CASTNET_Outgoing/data/ozone.zip).\n\n2. **Daily Census Tract-Level Ozone Concentrations**: The CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network offers modeled predictions of ozone levels from the EPA's Downscaler model for various years, including data at the census tract level. While the exact year 2020 might not be directly available in my current search results, datasets for years like 2011-2014, 2011-2015, and other periods are accessible. These can be downloaded as CSV files from the CDC website, for example, [https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/372p-dx3h/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD](https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/372p-dx3h/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) for the 2011-2014 dataset.\n\n3. **Improved Estimation of Trends in U.S. Ozone Concentrations Adjusted for Interannual Variability in Meteorological Conditions**: This dataset contains daily meteorology and ozone data for 2000 through 2016, which might be useful for analyzing trends over time, including the year 2020. It can be accessed through [https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1520465/MetAdj_data.zip](https://pasteur.epa.gov/uploads/10.23719/1520465/MetAdj_data.zip).\n\nEach of these datasets was selected because it pertains to ozone concentrations in the United States, aligning with your request. However, the availability of data specifically for the year 2020 varies, and some datasets may require analysis to extract the desired information.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific or refined data, please let me know, and I can attempt to provide more targeted results or suggest alternative avenues for finding the exact data you need."
