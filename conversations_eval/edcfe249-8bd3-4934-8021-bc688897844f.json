      "text": "Based on your request for JSON datasets of precipitation totals in Asia between 1990 and 2000, I've searched through various climate and meteorological datasets. Although the exact match is challenging without more specific criteria, I've found some relevant datasets that might interest you:\n\n1. **Monthly Precipitation Totals 1939-2015**: This dataset, available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, provides monthly precipitation totals. While it's not exclusively for Asia or the specified time frame, it does offer long-term data that could be filtered for the Asian region and the desired years. [Download from here](https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/DownloadFile/58582?Reference=57628).\n\n2. **RSS MONTHLY 1-DEG MICROWAVE TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER NETCDF V7R01**: This dataset from NASA's Earthdata repository offers global total columnar water vapor values over ocean areas, which can be relevant for understanding precipitation patterns. It covers a broader time frame and area but could be useful for studies involving Asia. [Explore more here](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=rss1tpwnv7r01).\n\n3. **NASA Water Vapor Project MEaSUREs (NVAP-M)**: NVAP-M provides high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The project includes several datasets, such as NVAP-M Climate, NVAP-M Weather, and NVAP-M Ocean, which could be useful for studying precipitation trends in Asia during the 1990s. [Access NVAP-M datasets here](https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/NVAP-M).\n\nTo refine your search, could you please specify:\n- Particular countries or regions within Asia you're interested in?\n- The type of precipitation data you're looking for (e.g., monthly, annual, daily totals)?\n- Any specific units of measurement for precipitation totals you prefer?\n\nThis additional information will help narrow down the search to datasets that more closely match your requirements."

Additional data includes measurements of temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, pressure, and solar and infrared radiation flux. These data were gathered during the GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) at the CARE and SkyDive sites in Ontario, Canada during November 7, 2011 - February 21, 2012. These data sets were collected to aid in the achievement of the over arching goal of GCPEx which is to characterize the ability of multi-frequency active and passive microwave sensors to detect and estimate falling snow.",

The 1 degree TPW dataset is a merged ocean product constructed using version 7 (V7) passive microwave geophysical ocean products made publicly available by RSS (www.remss.com). TPW values for this dataset were acquired from the following satellite microwave radiometers: SSM/I F08 through F15, SSMIS F16 and F17, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat. The radiometers used to construct this dataset were were inter-calibrated at the brightness temperature level, while the V7 ocean products were produced using a consistent processing methodology across sensors.",

      "description": "NVAP_OCEAN_Total-Precipitable-Water data set includes only data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and intends to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets. The data set is used for studies of climate change, interannual variability, and independent comparison to other ocean-only data sets. The new NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) data sets are produced under the NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program and is named NVAP-M. It supersedes the previous NVAP data set. NVAP-M continues the legacy of providing high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The use of improved, intercalibrated data sets and algorithms that were not available for the heritage NVAP data set results in an improved and extended water vapor data set that is stable enough for climate research and of a resolution appropriate for studies on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The true value of NVAP-M will be seen in outcomes from applied and research users of the data set in various fields. Some initial NVAP-M findings are presented in Vonder Haar et al. (2012). In addition to the time-dependent artifacts present in the previous NVAP data set, a wealth of new data has become available since the last NVAP processing in 2003. These include an additional SSM/I instrument, additional NOAA satellites, the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)-Aqua Satellite, which carries the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well as water vapor information from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. This extension and reprocessing effort increases the temporal coverage from 14 to 22 (1988-2009) years, making the data set more useful and consistent for investigation of the long-term trends which are hypothesized to occur as Earth warms. In addition to the long-standing daily, 1-degree gridded Total Precipitable Water (TPW) and layered Precipitable Water (PW) products, NVAP-M includes additional products geared towards different scientific needs. Three separate processing streams produced products directed towards specific research goals. These are NVAP-M Climate, designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications, and NVAP-M Weather, designed to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution products for use in studies on shorter time scales as well as weather case studies. Additionally, an ocean-only (NVAP-M Ocean) version includes only data from the SSM/I and is intended to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets.",
