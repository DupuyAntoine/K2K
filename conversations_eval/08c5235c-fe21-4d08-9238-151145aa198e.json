      "text": "You are looking for datasets containing information on carbon emissions in North America, specifically for the years between 2010 and 2020, and you prefer the data to be in CSV format. Based on your request, I have found several datasets that might interest you.\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset, available from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel, among other things. While not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it does offer insights into carbon dioxide emissions at the state level. You can find this dataset at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**: This dataset is part of the Hestia Project, which aims to quantify, simulate, and visualize greenhouse gases emitted in urban regions. The data for Indianapolis is available at the county level with a 200 m grid resolution and covers hourly and yearly time frames from 2010 to 2015. You can access it via [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341).\n\n3. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Baltimore, Maryland**: Similar to the Indianapolis dataset, this one provides activity data at the county level with a 200 m grid resolution, focusing on Baltimore, Maryland, from 2010. The URL for this dataset is [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342).\n\n4. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: This dataset offers estimates of hourly carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States, covering 2012 through 2017. It includes emissions from ten distinct sectors and is available in NetCDF version 4 format. Find it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n\n5. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations for several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Baltimore, from 2010. It's part of the Hestia Project and builds upon the Vulcan Project's national emissions grid. The data can be found at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nThese datasets were selected because they directly address carbon emissions or closely related topics within North America during the specified time frame. However, please note that some of these datasets might not be in CSV format but can potentially be converted or accessed through the provided links.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific data, such as emissions from a particular sector (e.g., industrial, transportation) or type of emission (e.g., CO2, methane), please let me know, and I can try to refine the search. Additionally, specifying a particular country or region within North America could help narrow down the results."
