      "text": "I've conducted a search based on your request for GEOJSON datasets related to land use change in the Pacific Ocean between 2000 and 2010. Although the search yielded several datasets related to land use and land cover changes, none directly match the specific criteria of focusing on the Pacific Ocean and being in GEOJSON format. However, I can provide information on datasets that might be relevant or useful for your research, albeit requiring some adjustments or further processing to meet your exact needs.\n\n1. **Historical Land-Cover Change and Land-Use Conversions Global Dataset**: This dataset, available from NOAA, provides global land use and land cover change estimates from 1770 to 2010. While it's not specific to the Pacific Ocean and not in GEOJSON format, it offers a broad perspective on historical land use changes that could be relevant for understanding global patterns, including those affecting areas surrounding the Pacific.\n\n2. **LCMAP Hawaii Reference Data Product land cover, land use and change process attributes**: This dataset from the USGS focuses on Hawaii, which is within the Pacific Ocean, and provides land cover, land use, and change process variables from 2000 to 2019. It's not exclusively about the Pacific Ocean but includes data on land use changes in a significant Pacific island chain. The data is available in formats that could potentially be converted to GEOJSON for spatial analysis.\n\n3. **Land Use and Land Cover Change Projection in the ABoVE Domain**: Although this dataset is tailored for the Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) domain and not specifically for the Pacific Ocean, it demonstrates how land use and land cover change projections can be modeled and provides insight into how similar data for the Pacific might be structured or analyzed.\n\nTo find datasets that more closely match your criteria, I would need more specific information:\n- Are you looking for land use changes in specific regions of the Pacific, such as near certain island nations or along particular coastlines?\n- Are there particular types of land use changes you're interested in (e.g., deforestation, urbanization, agricultural expansion)?\n- Are there specific data producers or datasets you prefer or require?\n\nWithout more detailed information, it's challenging to pinpoint exact datasets. However, the mentioned datasets can serve as a starting point for understanding land use and land cover changes on a global scale or in specific areas within the Pacific Ocean's vicinity. For obtaining data in GEOJSON format or for a precise geographic location like the Pacific Ocean, you might need to look into databases that specialize in geographic or environmental data, such as those from NASA, the European Space Agency, or national geographical surveys, and possibly convert available data into the desired format."

      "description": "A set of three estimates of land-cover types and annual transformations of land use are provided on a global 0.5 x0.5 degree lat/lon grid at annual time steps. The longest of the three estimates spans 1770-2010. The dataset presented here takes into account land-cover change due to four major land-use/management activities: (1) cropland expansion and abandonment, (2) pastureland expansion and abandonment, (3) urbanization, and (4) secondary forest regrowth due to wood harvest. Due to uncertainties associated with estimating historical agricultural (crops and pastures) land use, the study uses three widely accepted global reconstruction of cropland and pastureland in combination with common wood harvest and urban land data set to provide three distinct estimates of historical land-cover change and underlying land-use conversions. Hence, these distinct historical reconstructions offer a wide range of plausible regional estimates of uncertainty and extent to which different ecosystem have undergone changes. The three estimates use a consistent methodology, and start with a common land-cover map during pre-industrial conditions (year 1765), taking different courses as determined by the land-use/management datasets (cropland, pastureland, urbanization and wood harvest) to attain forest area distributions close to satellite estimates of forests for contemporary period. The satellite based estimates of forest area are based on MODIS sensor. All data uses the WGS84 spatial coordinate system for mapping.",

      "description": "Modeled projections for deep decarbonization require large amounts of solar energy, which may compete with other land uses such as agriculture, urbanization, and conservation of natural lands. Existing capacity expansion models do not integrate land use land cover change (LULC) dynamics into projections. We explored the interaction between projected LULC and solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment by integrating projections of LULC with a model that can project future deployment of solar PV with high spatial resolution for the conterminous United States. We used four scenarios of LULC projections from 2010 to 2050 and two electricity grid scenarios to model future PV deployment and compare those results against a baseline that held 2010 land cover constant through 2050. Though solar PV’s overall technical potential was minimally impacted by LULC scenarios, deployed PV varied by -16.5 to 11.6% in 2050 from the baseline scenario. Land requirements for projected PV were similar to other studies, while measures of PV impacts on natural systems depended on the underlying land change dynamics occurring in a scenario. The solar PV deployed through 2050 resulted in 1.1%–2.4% of croplands and 0.3%–0.7% of natural lands being converted to PV. However, the deepest understanding of PV impacts and interactions with land cover emerge when the complete net gains and losses from all land cover change dynamics, including PV, are integrated. For example, one of the four LULC projections allows for large solar development and a net gain in natural lands, even though PV drives a larger percentage of natural land conversion. This paper represents an initial step in integrating land cover change dynamics with energy expansion models, suggesting it may be possible to capture bidirectional relationships between energy and other processes that require land.",

      "description": "Hydrologic indicator statistics were computed for 82 selected surface water sites located throughout Minnesota using daily streamflow data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS). The 187 hydrologic indicator statistics were computed in RStudio version 3.5.0 using the EflowStats version 5.0.0 (Mills and Blodgett, 2017) and NWCCompare version 5.0 (Blodgett, 2017). The computed hydrologic indicator statistics encompass the five components of hydrologic conditions: magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change. Magnitude is the amount of water moving past a fixed location in a given unit of time. Frequency refers to how often streamflows above a given magnitude recur over a specified time interval. Duration is the period of time associated with a specific streamflow condition. Timing refers to the regularity with which streamflows of a given magnitude occur, and rate of change refers to how quickly the magnitude of streamflow changes (Poff and others, 1997). Site selection was based on sites previously selected in three other studies evaluating long-term streamflow records for trends (Novatny and Stefan, 2007; Peterson, Nieber, and Kanivetsky, 2011; Ziegeweid et.al, 2015). Nontrend sites were shown to not have trends in streamflow that were not related to precipitation. Hydrologic indicator statistics were computed for two periods: 1) the pre-period from 10-1-1944 through 9-30-1979 and 2) the post-period from 10-1-1980 through 9-30-2015. Exact dates of the start of trends varied among sites, but 1980 was the selected cutoff period based on an approximation of the largest cluster and on other anecdotal evidence of changes in farming practices. Both categories also had at least 10 water years with complete streamflow data. \nBlodgett, D., 2017, NWCCompare: Returns NWC comparison stats for two daily data sets version 5.0, https://github.com/USGS-R/NWCCompare. \nMills, J., and Blodgett, D., 2017, EflowStats: Hydrologic Indicator and Alterations Stats version 5.0.0, https://github.com/USGS-R/EflowStats. \nNovotny, E.V., and Stefan, H.G., 2007, Stream flow in Minnesota: Indicator of climate change, Journal of Hydrology 334: 319-333. \nPeterson, H.M., Nieber, J.L., and Kanivetsky, R., 2011, Hydrologic regionalization to assess anthropogenic changes, Journal of Hydrology 408: 212-225. \nZiegeweid, J.R., Lorenz, D.L., Sanocki, C.A., and Czuba, C.R., 2015, Methods for estimating flow-duration curve and low-flow frequency statistics for ungaged locations on small streams in Minnesota: U.S. Geological Survey Scientific Investigations Report 2015–5170, 23 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/sir20155170.",

      "description": "To support coordinated conservation, wetland restoration, and climate adaptation planning, we have developed five future scenarios of the Central Valley's seasonally flooded cropland and wetland waterbird habitat based on the State’s most recent climate and land use projections (Wilson et al. 2021).The USGS Western Geographic Science Center and Point Blue Conservation Science modeled a Business-as-Usual scenario plus the four scenarios developed for the Central Valley Landscape Conservation Project, which diverged along two key themes: water availability and management for conservation. Scenarios varied by climate projection (hot and wet vs. warm and dry) and management priorities (wetland restoration rate, crop conversion rate, and prioritization of water for wetland and cropland habitats). Urbanization rates were the same for all scenarios. To model these scenarios, we integrated a hydrologic and water-use model (the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) model, WEAP-CVwh, Matchett and Fleskes, 2017) with a land change model (the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator, LUCAS, Wilson et al. 2020). The models produced annual maps of land use change and monthly maps of flooded habitat probability at 270-meter resolution, from 2011 to 2101 (Wilson et al. 2021). The scenarios were:\nHistorical Business As Usual (HBAU) = historical water availability, historical management\nCalifornia Dreamin' (DREAM) = high water, good management\nBad Business As Usual (BBAU) = high water, poor management\nEveryone Equally Miserable (EEM) = low water, good management\nCentral Valley Dustbowl (DUST) = low water, poor management\nThis data release contains three types of model output tabular summaries for four geographic areas: WEAP model zones, Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) California Bulletin 118 groundwater sub-basins, Central Valley Joint Venture (CVJV) planning basins, and Central Valley regions. The datasets summarize 1) land use change for select land use/land cover classes, 2) area of likely flooded habitat, and 3) change in January flooded habitat area and its causes for the 5 future scenarios of managed waterbird habitat. The datasets were generated from the LUCAS model and the WEAP CVwh model as described in the parent manuscript. The full methods and results of this research are described in detail in the parent manuscript \"Integrated modeling of climate and land change impacts on future dynamic wetland habitat – a case study from California’s Central Valley\" (2021).
