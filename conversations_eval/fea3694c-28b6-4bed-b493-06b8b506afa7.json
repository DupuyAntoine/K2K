      "text": "You are looking for average precipitation rates in South America for the period between 2000 and 2015. Based on your request, I have searched through various datasets and found several that may be relevant to your query.\n\n1. **Optical Rain Gauge measurements: precipitation rate and accumulation**: This dataset, available at [http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::org](http://www.archive.arm.gov/discovery/#v/results/s/s::org), contains measurements related to precipitation rate and accumulation, although it may not specifically focus on South America or the exact time frame you're interested in.\n\n2. **ISLSCP II Global Precipitation Climatology Project Version 1, Pentad Precipitation**: Found at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpcp_precip_pentad_xdeg_1002&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpcp_precip_pentad_xdeg_1002&ac=true), this dataset provides global precipitation rates for 5-day periods, which could be useful for calculating average precipitation rates over larger periods.\n\n3. **CPC Merged Analysis of Precipitation**: Available at [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.cmap.html](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.cmap.html), this dataset offers monthly global averaged precipitation rate values starting from 1979, which could be aggregated to meet your needs for the 2000-2015 period in South America.\n\n4. **Precipitation Reconstruction (PREC)**: Located at [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prec.html](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.prec.html), this analysis provides monthly precipitation constructed on a 2.5° lat/lon grid over the globe from 1948 to the present, which includes your desired time frame and region.\n\n5. **ISLSCP II Global Precipitation Climatology Project Version 2, Monthly Precipitation**: Found at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpcp_precip_monthly_xdeg_1003&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=gpcp_precip_monthly_xdeg_1003&ac=true), this dataset includes global monthly precipitation rates and associated random errors, which can be specifically filtered for South America and the years 2000-2015.\n\nThese datasets were selected because they all relate to precipitation measurements or analyses on a global or regional scale, and each provides data that could be used to calculate or estimate average precipitation rates for the specified time period and geographical area. However, the specific focus, resolution, and format of the data vary, so it's essential to review the details of each dataset to determine which best fits your needs.\n\nIf you require more precise data or have specific format requirements (e.g., CSV, JSON), please let me know, and I can attempt to refine the search or suggest alternative datasets. Additionally, if you're interested in a particular aspect of precipitation (e.g., seasonal variations, trends), please specify, and I can try to find more targeted information."
