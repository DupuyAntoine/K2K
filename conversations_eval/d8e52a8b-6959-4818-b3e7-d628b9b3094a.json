      "text": "Based on your request for JSON datasets of carbon emissions in North America between 2010 and 2020, I've searched through various datasets to find the most relevant ones for you. \n\nIt appears that there are several datasets available that match your criteria. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel from 2010 to 2020. Although it's not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it does provide relevant data on energy consumption, which can be used to estimate carbon emissions. You can access this dataset at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana**: This dataset, available from 2010 to 2015, provides high spatial and temporal resolution data on fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions for Indianapolis, Indiana. The data is part of the Hestia Project, which aims to quantify, simulate, and visualize greenhouse gas emissions in urban regions. You can find this dataset at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341).\n\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System, 2012-2017, Version 2**: This dataset from the NASA Carbon Monitoring System provides estimates of hourly carbon dioxide emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States, covering the years 2012 through 2017. The data includes emissions from various sectors such as airports, commercial buildings, and electric power generation facilities. You can access this dataset at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n\n4. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides data products for several U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and the Northeast Corridor, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide emitted by urban regions. The data is available from 2010 and offers high spatial and temporal resolution CO2 concentrations at sub-county resolutions and annual/hourly time scales. You can find more information at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nThese datasets were selected because they provide relevant information on carbon emissions in North America during the specified time period. However, please note that the availability of JSON format might vary, and some datasets may require additional processing to meet your specific requirements.\n\nIf you're unable to find a dataset that exactly matches your needs, I recommend providing more specific details about the type of carbon emissions data you're looking for (e.g., sector-specific, geographic resolution, or particular variables of interest). Additionally, you might want to consider exploring datasets from other sources or reaching out to researchers in the field of environmental science or carbon emissions for more tailored guidance."
