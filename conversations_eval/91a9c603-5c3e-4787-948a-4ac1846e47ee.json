      "text": "Based on your request for aerosol optical depth datasets in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000 in XLS format, I have conducted a search to find relevant data that matches your criteria. \n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not yield any datasets that exactly match your request for XLS format and the specific geographic and temporal criteria. However, several datasets related to aerosol optical depth were found, which might be useful for your research, although they may require conversion or processing to meet your specific format needs.\n\nHere are a few datasets that were identified:\n1. **NIMFR: derived total & aerosol optical depth from 1st Michalsky algorithm** - This dataset, accessible through the ARM Discovery website, involves aerosol optical depth measurements but does not specify the format as XLS. It might be necessary to convert the data or contact the provider for more information.\n2. **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VIS Aerosol Optical Depths** and **Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, NIR Aerosol Optical Depths** - These datasets from the ARM archive contain aerosol optical depth data, but again, the format and specific temporal/spatial focus might not exactly match your request.\n3. **High Mountain Asia MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth V001** - Although this dataset from NASA's Earth Observing System focuses on a different region (High Mountain Asia), it does contain aerosol optical depth data from 2000 onwards, which might be of interest if you're looking to expand your temporal coverage or compare with another region.\n4. **Earth Observatory Aerosol Optical Depth** - This resource provides general information on aerosol optical depth and includes educational content and possibly datasets, but it does not directly offer XLS formatted data for the specified region and time frame.\n5. **MODIS/Aqua and Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth** datasets - These datasets offer near-real-time aerosol optical depth data from the MODIS instruments on the Aqua and Terra satellites. While they cover a broader area and are in a different format, they could be valuable for aerosol research and might be convertible to XLS for analysis.\n\nGiven the constraints and the datasets found, it seems that there might not be a direct match for aerosol optical depth data in Antarctica from 1990 to 2000 in XLS format readily available. For future searches, specifying the producer or dataset/source could help narrow down the results. Additionally, considering alternative formats or expanding the search to related datasets could provide more options for your research needs.\n\nTo proceed, you might want to:\n- Contact the providers of the mentioned datasets to inquire about the possibility of obtaining the data in XLS format or for a specific region like Antarctica.\n- Explore other databases or scientific repositories that might hold historical aerosol optical depth data for the Antarctic region.\n- Consider reaching out to research institutions or scientists who have published studies on aerosol optical depth in Antarctica, as they might have access to or knowledge of relevant datasets.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with accessing these datasets, please let me know."

Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MYDAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. The MYDAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
