      "text": "You're looking for datasets related to aerosol optical depth in Antarctica, specifically for the period between 1990 and 2000, and you need the data in JSON format. Based on your request, I've searched through various datasets and found a few that might be relevant to your needs.\n\n1. **MODIS/Terra L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**: This dataset, available from NASA, provides aerosol optical depth data from the Terra satellite. While it doesn't exactly match your 1990-2000 time frame since the Terra satellite was launched in 1999, it's a valuable resource for aerosol optical depth data starting from 2000 onwards. You can find more information and download the data from [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt).\n\n2. **MODIS/Terra+Aqua L3 Value-added Aerosol Optical Depth - NRT**: Similar to the previous dataset, this combines data from both the Terra and Aqua satellites, offering a more comprehensive coverage of aerosol optical depth. However, the data starts from 2002 for Aqua. More details can be found at [https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt).\n\n3. **Earth Observatory Aerosol Optical Depth**: This resource from NASA provides information on aerosol optical depth but doesn't directly offer downloadable datasets in JSON format for the specified time period. However, it's a useful resource for understanding aerosol optical depth and its implications. You can visit [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_OD&eocn=home&eoci=globalmaps](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/GlobalMaps/view.php?d1=MODAL2_M_AER_OD&eocn=home&eoci=globalmaps) for more information.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find datasets that exactly match your criteria of aerosol optical depth in Antarctica between 1990 and 2000 in JSON format. Many datasets either start later than 1990 or do not specifically focus on Antarctica. For more precise data, you might need to contact specific research institutions or datasets providers that focus on Antarctica and aerosol optical depth measurements during that period.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or if there's anything else I can help you with, please let me know."

Flights originated from Pietersburg, South Africa; Kasane, Botswana; and Walvis Bay, Namibia. The AATS-14 instrument measures the transmission of the direct solar beam at 14 discrete wavelengths (350-1558 nm) from which we derived spectral aerosol optical depths (AOD) and columnar water vapor (CWV). Flying at different altitudes over a fixed location allows derivation of layer AOD and CWV. Data taken during vertical profiles allows derivation of aerosol extinction and water vapor density.",

      "description": "MODIS was launched aboard the Terra satellite on December 18, 1999 (10:30 am equator crossing time) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) mission. MODIS with its 2330 km viewing swath width provides almost daily global coverage. It acquires data in 36 high spectral resolution bands between 0.415 to 14.235 micron with spatial resolutions of 250m(2 bands), 500m(5 bands),and 1000m (29 bands). MODIS sensor counts, calibrated radiances, geolocation products and all derived geophysical atmospheric and ocean products are archived at various DAACs and has been made available to public since April 2000.The shortname for this level-3 MODIS aerosol product is MODAODHD. The Naval Research Laboratory and the University of North Dakota developed this value-added aerosol optical depth dataset based on MODIS Level 2 aerosol products. MODAODHD is a gridded product and is specifically designed for quantitative applications including data assimilation and model validation. It is available through LANCE-MODIS. It offers several enhancements over the MODIS Level 2 data on which it is based. These enhancements include stringent filtering to reduce outliers, eliminate cloud contamination, and exclude conditions where aerosol detection is likely to be inaccurate; reduction of systematic biases over land and ocean by empirical corrections; reduction of random variation in AOD values by spatial averaging; quantitative estimation of uncertainty for each AOD data point.The MxDAODHD granules are produced every six hours, and time-stamped 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00 (all times UTC). Each granule includes MODIS observations from +/-3 hours from the timestamp (e.g. 12:00 product includes MODIS data from 09:00-15:00 UTC). Production is initiated as soon as the Level 2 inputs become available in the LANCE system.See the LANCE-MODIS page for more dataset information: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/download-nrt-data/modis-nrt",
