      "text": "I've searched for datasets related to carbon emissions in North America between 2010 and 2020. Here are some relevant results:\n\n1. **State carbon dioxide emissions data**: This dataset from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides annual state-level estimates of energy consumption, prices, and expenditures for jet fuel. Although it's not exclusively focused on carbon emissions, it does contain relevant data. You can access it at [https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/state/).\n2. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions**: The Hestia Project offers high spatial and temporal resolution datasets for various urban regions in the United States, including Indianapolis, Baltimore, and Los Angeles. These datasets quantify greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel combustion. You can find the datasets at [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503341) and [https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342](https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1503342).\n3. **Anthropogenic Carbon Emission System**: This dataset from NASA provides estimates of hourly carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion at a 1-km resolution for the coterminous United States. It covers the years 2012 through 2017 and is available in NetCDF format. You can access it at [https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=NACP_ACES_V2_1943&ac=true).\n4. **Hestia Fossil Fuel Carbon Dioxide Emissions Inventory for Urban Regions**: This dataset provides data products for various U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Baltimore. It quantifies greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, from fossil fuel combustion at sub-county resolutions and annual/hourly time scales. You can find the dataset at [https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503](https://doi.org/10.18434/t4/1502503).\n\nThese datasets were selected because they match your criteria of providing carbon emissions data for North America between 2010 and 2020. However, please note that some datasets might have more specific focuses, such as urban regions or fossil fuel combustion.\n\nIf you're looking for more specific data or have further questions, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to assist you. Additionally, if you could provide more information about the type of carbon emissions data you're interested in (e.g., sector-specific, type of emissions), I can try to provide more targeted results."
