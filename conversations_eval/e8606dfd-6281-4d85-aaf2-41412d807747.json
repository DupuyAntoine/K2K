      "text": "You are looking for global sea surface temperature anomalies between 1990 and 2010. Based on your request, I have found several datasets that may be relevant to your search.\n\nThe following datasets contain global sea surface temperature anomalies and cover the specified time period:\n\n1. **Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST)**: This dataset provides global monthly sea surface temperature analysis from 1854 to present, including anomalies computed with respect to a 1971-2000 monthly climatology. You can find more information at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/sst/ersstv3.php and http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.html.\n2. **COBE Sea Surface Temperature**: This dataset is a gridded 1x1 resolution SST monitoring dataset that starts in 1891 and extends to near present. It is used as input for the JMA Climate Data Assimilation System and the Japanese 25-year Re-analyses. More information can be found at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.cobe.html.\n3. **NCEI ocean heat content, temperature anomalies, salinity anomalies, thermosteric sea level anomalies, and total steric sea level anomalies**: This dataset contains ocean heat content change, oceanic temperature and salinity changes, and steric sea level change, which are important variables for monitoring the oceanic environment. You can find more information at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/climate-data-records/global-ocean-heat-content.\n\nTo access these datasets, please visit the provided URLs.

The RADS data for each mission is updated with state of the art corrections for tides, atmospheric path delay, etc. Because they are all computed consistently between the various missions, this avoids the possibility of introducing biases and drifts because of the different implementation of the various corrections by different agencies. The goals of RADS are to provide a homogenous dataset of sea level anomalies, wave heights, and wind speeds, along with database selection and analysis tools.",

NCEI, as the repository for oceanic subsurface profile data, especially for temperature and salinity profiles, has the data to calculate historic and recent changes in the above mentioned ocean variables. Data gathered from the NCEI archives, uniformly formatted and quality controlled in the World Ocean Database, are used to calculate temperature (and salinity) differences from a long-term climatological mean (the World Ocean Atlas series) at specific depth levels.  These anomalies are used to derive integrals of ocean heat content and means for all other variables listed above.",
