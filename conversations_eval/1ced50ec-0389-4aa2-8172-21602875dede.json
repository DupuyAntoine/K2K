      "text": "You're looking for JSON datasets related to sea level rise on a global scale, specifically covering the period from 2015 to 2023. After conducting a thorough search, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your request. However, I must note that the exact datasets you're seeking might not be readily available in JSON format or might require specific access permissions.\n\nHere are a few datasets that could be useful, although they might not perfectly match your criteria:\n\n1. **Sea-Level Rise Viewer**: This dataset from the California State Lands Commission provides data on sea level rise, although it's more focused on California. It includes databases of planning documents and widgets for exploring underlying data. You can access it through [this link](https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/apps/CSLC::sea-level-rise-viewer).\n\n2. **2080s Mean Sea Level Rise Projections**: Provided by the New York City Panel on Climate Change (2019), this dataset offers projections for New York City in the 2080s. While it's not global and doesn't cover your specified time frame, it gives valuable insight into sea level rise projections. The data can be downloaded from [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/w7sh-mt94/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).\n\n3. **NOAA Office for Coastal Management Sea Level Rise Data**: This dataset includes potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. It provides data on the inundation extent for 1-10 ft sea level rise. Although not exclusively in JSON format and more focused on the U.S., it's a valuable resource for understanding sea level rise impacts. You can find more information at [this link](https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr).\n\nGiven the global nature of your request and the specificity of the JSON format, I recommend exploring datasets from international organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which often provide global data on climate change and sea level rise. You might need to convert data from other formats to JSON or contact these organizations for more tailored datasets.\n\nIf you have any more specific details about the datasets you're looking for, such as particular metrics (e.g., mean sea level, sea level anomaly) or producers (e.g., NASA, ESA), please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

      "description": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nThese data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.5 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions in half foot increments. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).\n\nThe model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.\n\nBoth raster and vector data are provided for each sea level rise amount above MHHW. The raster data represent both the horizontal extent of inundation and depth above ground, in meters. The vector data represent the horizontal extent of both hydrologically connected and unconnected inundation. The vector \"slr\" data represent inundation that is hydrologically connected to the ocean. The vector \"low\" data represent areas that are hydrologically unconnected to the ocean, but are below the sea level rise amount and may also flood.\n\nFor more information, contact coastal.info@noaa.gov.",
