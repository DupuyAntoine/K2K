      "text": "Based on your search criteria, I've found several datasets related to river discharge in Africa between 2015 and 2023. However, I must point out that the search results didn't exactly match your request for NETCDF format, but I'll provide you with the closest options.\n\nThe datasets I found are primarily from NASA and other reputable sources. Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Global River Discharge Data Set (RivDIS)**: This dataset contains monthly averaged discharge measurements for 1,018 stations worldwide, including some in Africa. Although it doesn't exactly match your date range (it goes from 1807 to 1991), it's a valuable resource for understanding river discharge patterns. The dataset is available in ASCII format, but it might be useful for your research.\n2. **SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: This dataset is a subset of the CPEP Global River Discharge Data Set, focusing on southern Africa. It contains monthly mean discharge data for various sites, but the period of record varies. The data is in ASCII format, and while it doesn't perfectly match your criteria, it's a relevant resource for the region.\n3. **SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products Version 1**: This dataset provides estimates of river discharge derived from the SWOT mission, including both unconstrained and gauge-constrained estimates. Although it's not specifically limited to Africa, it does cover some African rivers. The data is available in netCDF format, which matches your request.\n\nTo access these datasets, you can visit the following links:\n\n* RivDIS: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=rivdis_199&ac=true\n* SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data: https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=river_discharge_cpep_640&ac=true\n* SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products: https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC\n\nPlease note that some of these datasets might require registration or have specific usage guidelines. Be sure to review the documentation and terms of use before downloading or using the data.\n\nIf you're unable to find a suitable dataset, I recommend providing more specific information about the river basin or region you're interested in, as well as any other relevant details. This will help me refine the search and provide more targeted results."

The SWOT mission is implemented jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.Sword of Science data products are generated from the open-source SWOT Confluence program and contain river discharge parameter estimates as well as discharge time series for both river reaches and river nodes, following the SWOT River Database (SWORD) structure. Granules from both constrained and unconstrained branches are composed of prior information (e.g., mean annual flow predicted by global hydrological models) and the resulting discharge estimates. Priors and results files for both constrained and unconstrained branches are available in netCDF format. Users are encouraged to reference the SWOT Confluence documentation and notebook tutorials for full documentation of the data structure and variables available.Development of the SWOT Confluence program as well as the Sword of Science data products was funded by NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program.",

The subset was created for the study area of the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) in South America (i.e., 10° N to 25° S, 30° to 85° W).The global river discharge data set (Coe and Olejniczak 1999), formerly known as the \"Climate, People, and Environment Program (CPEP) Global River Discharge Database,\" is a compilation of monthly mean discharge data for more than 2600 sites worldwide. The data were compiled from RivDIS Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy. The period of record for the sites varies from 3 years to greater than 100.The purpose of the global compilation is to provide detailed hydrographic information for the climate research community in as general a format as possible. Data are given in units of meters cubed per second (m**3/sec) and are in ASCII format. Data from stations that had less than 3 years of information or that had a basin area less than 5000 square kilometers were excluded from the global data set. Thus, the data sources may include more sites than the data set by Coe and Olejniczak (1999).

NASA was a lead sponsor for several experiments. LBA was designed to create the new knowledge needed to understand the climatological, ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological functioning of Amazonia; the impact of land use change on these functions; and the interactions between Amazonia and the Earth system.
