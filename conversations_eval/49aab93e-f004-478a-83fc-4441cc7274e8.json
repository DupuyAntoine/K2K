      "text": "Based on your request for JSON datasets of sea level rise on a global scale between 2015 and 2023, I've searched through our database to find relevant information for you. Unfortunately, the provided dataset search results don't directly match your request for global sea level rise data in JSON format for the specified years. However, I can guide you through some related datasets that might be helpful or suggest next steps to find what you're looking for.\n\nThe search results provided include various datasets related to sea level rise, but they are more focused on specific regions such as New York City or the San Francisco Bay area, and they might not cover the global scope you're interested in. Additionally, the formats available are mostly CSV, which is close to but not exactly what you requested in terms of JSON.\n\nHere are a few examples of datasets that were found, though they might not perfectly match your criteria:\n1. **Sea-Level Rise Viewer** by the California State Lands Commission - This resource, while focused on California, provides a comprehensive look at sea level rise impacts and includes tools for exploring underlying data. However, it's not specifically in JSON format.\n2. **NOAA Office for Coastal Management Sea Level Rise Data** - This dataset provides information on potential sea level rise inundation extents for different scenarios, including 1-10 feet of sea level rise. It's a valuable resource for understanding coastal impacts but is not in JSON format and is more U.S.-focused.\n\nGiven the specific nature of your request, I would recommend a few next steps:\n- **Check NOAA's Website**: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) often provides datasets in various formats, including JSON, on their website. You can explore their sea level rise data offerings to see if anything matches your criteria.\n- **Contact Data Providers Directly**: Sometimes, the exact dataset you need might not be publicly available or easily accessible. Contacting the producers of sea level rise data directly, such as research institutions or governmental agencies like NASA or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), might yield more specific results.\n- **Convert Available Data**: If you find datasets in other formats (like CSV) that match your content needs, you could consider converting them into JSON. There are various tools and scripts available online that can help with this process.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more guidance on where to find specific types of data or how to convert file formats, feel free to ask."

      "description": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nThese data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.5 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions in half foot increments. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).\n\nThe model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.\n\nBoth raster and vector data are provided for each sea level rise amount above MHHW. The raster data represent both the horizontal extent of inundation and depth above ground, in meters. The vector data represent the horizontal extent of both hydrologically connected and unconnected inundation. The vector \"slr\" data represent inundation that is hydrologically connected to the ocean. The vector \"low\" data represent areas that are hydrologically unconnected to the ocean, but are below the sea level rise amount and may also flood.\n\nFor more information, contact coastal.info@noaa.gov.",
