      "text": "You're looking for surface albedo data specifically for the region of Greenland, covering the period from 2000 to 2020. Based on your request, I've found several datasets that might be relevant to your needs.\n\n1. **Multilayer Greenland Ice Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, and Water Vapor from MODIS V001**: This dataset includes surface albedo data, among other parameters, for Greenland at a 0.78 km resolution, spanning from March 2000 to December 2019, with an extension of the ice surface temperature data up to August 2021. The data is provided by NASA and can be accessed through their Earthdata portal.\n\n2. **MODIS/Terra+Aqua BRDF/Albedo Albedo Daily L3 Global - 500m V006 and V061**: These datasets offer daily albedo data at a 500-meter resolution, global in coverage, and include both black-sky and white-sky albedo for different bands. Though not exclusively focused on Greenland, they cover the region and the specified time frame, with V061 being an update to V006, incorporating improvements and corrections.\n\n3. **VIIRS/NPP BRDF/Albedo Albedo Daily L3 Global 500m SIN Grid V001**: Similar to the MODIS datasets but derived from the VIIRS instrument on the Suomi NPP satellite. It provides daily albedo values at 500 meters, including black-sky and white-sky albedo, which can be used for studying surface changes.\n\nFor direct access to these datasets and more detailed information, you can visit the NASA Earthdata portal (https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) or specific links provided in the dataset descriptions.\n\nBefore proceeding, I would like to clarify a few points to ensure I provide the most accurate information:\n- Are you looking for data in a specific format (e.g., CSV, NetCDF)?\n- Is there a particular type of surface albedo you're interested in (e.g., over ice, land, or a combination)?\n- Would you prefer data from a specific satellite or sensor if available?\n\nYour input will help narrow down the options and provide more tailored guidance on accessing the desired surface albedo data for Greenland."

The surface albedo was sampled as described in Barnsley et al. (2000) at intervals along transects radiating north, south, east, and west from the main instrumentation tower at the transitional vegetation site. Several of these transects were sampled on more than one occasion, under a range of solar illumination conditions. At the grassland site, albedo measurements were taken along a single transect, sampled at 10-m intervals, at three different times of day (i.e., at different solar zenith angles). In addition to the albedo data, hemispherical photographs were taken at each of the sample sites to provide a visual record, and the images were classified to estimate the proportion of bare soil, live vegetation, and woody ground cover.",

The LSA is a shortwave broadband blue-sky albedo over wavelengths between 0.4 and 3.0 Âµm. Besides the blue-sky broadband shortwave albedo, the LSA algorithm also generates spectral land surface reflectance as byproducts. The frequent temporal refreshment, fine spectral resolution and large spatial coverage make ABI a unique data source for mapping LSA.

At the Mongu site, Kipp and Zonen albedometers housing both upward- and downward-looking pyranometers were outfitted with clear and red domes to collect broadband albedo and radiation fluxes in the shortwave (SW) and near-infrared  (NIR) wavebands, respectively. The data are mean values provided at 15-minute intervals for 2000-2002. At the Skukuza tower, Kipp and Zonen albedometers (also outfitted with clear and red domes) collected broadband albedo and radiation fluxes in the SW and NIR wavebands. In addition, a pyrgeometer was used to collect longwave radiation flux in thermal infrared (TIR) wavebands. The data at Skukuza are mean values provided at 30-minute intervals for 2000-2002, except for the TIR data, which are provided for 2001 and 2002 only. For both sites, photosynthetically active radiation can be calculated from measurements.The data are provided in comma-delimited ASCII files, with column headers. The SW and NIR data for both sites are provided in one file per year per site for 2000-2002. The Skukuza longwave data are provided separately, and for years 2001 and 2002 only.",

      "description": "The NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) and Albedo (VNP43IA3) Version 1 product provides albedo values at 500 meter (m) resolution for the bihemispherical reflectance white-sky albedo (WSA) and directional hemispherical reflectance black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon. The VNP43IA3 product is produced daily using 16 days of VIIRS data and is weighted temporally to the ninth day, which is reflected in the file name. The VNP43 data products are designed to promote the continuity of NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) BRDF/Albedo data product suite.The VNP43 algorithm uses the RossThick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) semi-empirical kernel-driven BRDF model, with the three kernel weights from [VNP43IA1](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA1.001) to reconstruct surface anisotropic effects, correcting the directional reflectance to a common view geometry ([VNP43IA4](https://doi.org/10.5067/VIIRS/VNP43IA4.001)), while also computing integrated black-sky albedo (BSA) at local solar noon and white-sky albedo (WSA) (VNP43IA3). Researchers can use the BRDF model parameters with a simple polynomial, to obtain black-sky albedo at any solar illumination angle. Likewise, both the BSA and WSA Science Dataset (SDS) layers can be used with a simple polynomial, to manually estimate instantaneous actual albedo (blue-sky albedo). Additional details regarding the methodology are available in the  Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).The VNP43IA3 product provides a total of 9 SDS layers including: BSA, WSA, and mandatory quality layers for VIIRS imagery bands: I1, I2, and I3. A low-resolution browse image is also available showing retrievals of WSA for band I1 in JPEG format.Known Issues* The abnormally high activation of the high aerosol flag in the Collection 1 (C1) VNP09 product has impacted downstream products. The VNP43 BRDF/Albedo/NBAR product is affected by reducing the number of otherwise acceptable observations used as input to characterize surface anisotropy. This effect (most obvious over arid bright surfaces) results in a reduced number of high quality full BRDF model inversions. Therefore, users should be aware that bright arid surfaces (normally associated with high quality BRDF/Albedo/NBAR retrievals) are likely to be somewhat represented by lower quality results in C1. VNP09 has been corrected for Collection 2 (C2). Therefore, users should avoid substantive use of C1 VNP43 over arid regions (and wait for C2 products). In any event, users are always strongly encouraged to download and use the extensive QA data provided in VNP43[I-M]A2, in addition to the briefer mandatory QA provided as part of the VNP43[I-M]A1, 3 and 4 products.* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=VIIRS).",
