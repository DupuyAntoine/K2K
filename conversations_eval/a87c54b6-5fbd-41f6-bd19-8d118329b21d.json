      "text": "Based on your search for CSV datasets of population density in the Pacific Ocean between 2000 and 2010, I've compiled a list of relevant datasets that might interest you. However, please note that population density data for the entire Pacific Ocean might be challenging to find, as most datasets focus on specific regions or countries.\n\nHere are a few datasets that were selected due to their relevance to population density and geographic coverage, although they may not perfectly match your criteria:\n\n1. **WAOFM - April 1 - Population Density by County, 2000 to Present**: This dataset provides intercensal and postcensal estimates of population density by county from 2000 to present. While it's focused on the United States, it could be useful for understanding population density trends in coastal counties bordering the Pacific Ocean. [Download CSV](https://data.wa.gov/api/views/c535-p92u/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD)\n\n2. **Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4): Population Density, Revision 11**: This global dataset estimates human population density for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. It's available in various resolutions, including 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator). Although it's not exclusively focused on the Pacific Ocean, it does cover the entire globe, including Pacific island nations and coastal areas. [More information](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.7927%2FH49C6VHW)\n\n3. **Global Population Density Grid Time Series Estimates**: This dataset provides a back-cast time series of population density grids based on the year 2000 population grid. It covers the globe, including the Pacific Ocean region, but the resolution might not be as fine as needed for detailed analysis. [More information](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.7927%2FH4XK8CG2)\n\nTo find datasets more specifically tailored to the Pacific Ocean and the exact time frame of 2000-2010, I would need more information. Could you please clarify if you're looking for data on:\n\n- Specific countries or regions within the Pacific Ocean?\n- Island nations or coastal areas?\n- A particular resolution (e.g., country-level, regional, city-level)?\n\nThis additional detail would help in narrowing down the search to provide more relevant datasets."

      "description": "The Global Population Density Grid Time Series Estimates provide a back-cast time series of population density grids based on the year 2000 population grid from SEDAC's Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) data set. The grids were created by using rates of population change between decades from the coarser resolution History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE) database to back-cast the GRUMPv1 population density grids. Mismatches between the spatial extent of the HYDE calculated rates and GRUMPv1 population data were resolved via infilling rate cells based on a focal mean of values. Finally, the grids were adjusted so that the population totals for each country equaled the UN World Population Prospects (2008 Revision) estimates for that country for the respective year (1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000).  These data do not represent census observations for the years prior to 2000, and therefore can at best be thought of as estimations of the populations in given locations. The population grids are consistent internally within the time series, but are not recommended for use in creating longer time series with any other population grids, including GRUMPv1, Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4), or non-SEDAC developed population grids. These population grids served as an input to SEDAC's Global Estimated Net Migration Grids by Decade: 1970-2000 data set.",

The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count raster for a given target year by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second (~1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research commUnities, the 30 arc-second count data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions to produce density rasters at these resolutions.",

A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing more than 300,000 national and sub-national administrative Units, is used to assign population values to grid cells.
