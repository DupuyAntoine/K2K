      "text": "You're looking for datasets related to sea level rise on a global scale, specifically between 2015 and 2023, and in CSV format. After conducting a search, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your query, although none directly match the exact criteria of being global, between 2015 and 2023, and in CSV format. Here are a few datasets that could be useful, along with a brief description of what each contains and why they were selected:\n\n1. **2080s Mean Sea Level Rise Projections**: This dataset, found on the New York City's open data platform, provides sea level rise projections for New York City in the 2080s. While it's not global and the time frame is later than your request, it's an example of detailed sea level rise data that could be useful for understanding projections. The dataset is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/w7sh-mt94/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/w7sh-mt94/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).\n\n2. **Sea-Level Rise Viewer**: Offered by the California State Lands Commission, this tool provides data and maps related to sea level rise in California. While it's not global, it's a comprehensive resource that includes databases of planning documents, datasets from various organizations, and interactive widgets for exploring underlying data. It can be accessed at [https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/apps/CSLC::sea-level-rise-viewer](https://gis.data.cnra.ca.gov/apps/CSLC::sea-level-rise-viewer).\n\n3. **NOAA Office for Coastal Management Sea Level Rise Data: 1-10 ft Sea Level Rise Inundation Extent**: This dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides potential sea level rise inundation extents for the United States, which could be considered for its relevance to part of your global query. It models different scenarios of sea level rise and its impacts on coastal areas. The data can be found at [https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr](https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr), though it may require further processing to extract the specific data you need in CSV format.\n\nTo find datasets that more closely match your criteria, I would suggest the following next steps:\n\n- **Specify the Producer or Source**: If you're looking for data from a specific organization, such as NASA or the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC), mentioning this could help narrow down the search.\n- **Define Specific Variables or Metrics**: Being more precise about what aspects of sea level rise you're interested in (e.g., mean sea level, sea level anomaly, tide gauge data) could help in identifying more relevant datasets.\n- **Consider Broader Time Frames or Geographies**: While your focus is on 2015-2023 and global data, some datasets might offer valuable insights over slightly broader time frames or for specific global regions.\n\nIf you have any more details or would like to refine your search based on these suggestions, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

      "description": "These data were created as part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office for Coastal Management's efforts to create an online mapping viewer depicting potential sea level rise and its associated impacts on the nation's coastal areas. The purpose of the mapping viewer is to provide coastal managers and scientists with a preliminary look at sea level rise (slr) and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help gauge trends and prioritize actions for different scenarios. The Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding Impacts Viewer may be accessed at: https://www.coast.noaa.gov/slr\n\nThese data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.5 to 10 feet rise in sea level above current Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) conditions in half foot increments. The process used to produce the data can be described as a modified bathtub approach that attempts to account for both local/regional tidal variability as well as hydrological connectivity. The process uses two source datasets to derive the final inundation rasters and polygons and accompanying low-lying polygons for each iteration of sea level rise: the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the area and a tidal surface model that represents spatial tidal variability. The tidal model is created using the NOAA National Geodetic Survey's VDATUM datum transformation software (http://vdatum.noaa.gov) in conjunction with spatial interpolation/extrapolation methods and represents the MHHW tidal datum in orthometric values (North American Vertical Datum of 1988).\n\nThe model used to produce these data does not account for erosion, subsidence, or any future changes in an area's hydrodynamics. It is simply a method to derive data in order to visualize the potential scale, not exact location, of inundation from sea level rise.\n\nBoth raster and vector data are provided for each sea level rise amount above MHHW. The raster data represent both the horizontal extent of inundation and depth above ground, in meters. The vector data represent the horizontal extent of both hydrologically connected and unconnected inundation. The vector \"slr\" data represent inundation that is hydrologically connected to the ocean. The vector \"low\" data represent areas that are hydrologically unconnected to the ocean, but are below the sea level rise amount and may also flood.\n\nFor more information, contact coastal.info@noaa.gov.",
