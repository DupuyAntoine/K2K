      "text": "Based on your request for XLSX datasets of wildfire occurrences globally between 2015 and 2023, I've conducted a thorough search. Unfortunately, the exact datasets matching your specific criteria (global, 2015-2023, XLSX format) are not readily available in the retrieved data. However, several relevant datasets related to wildfire occurrences in various regions and formats have been found.\n\nHere are a few datasets that might be of interest to you, although they may not perfectly match your requested criteria:\n\n1. **ODF Fire Occurrence Data 2000-2022**: This dataset from the Oregon Department of Forestry contains statistical wildfires from 2000 through 2022, including point locations and fire causes. While it's not global, it could be useful for understanding wildfire patterns in Oregon. (CSV format, downloadable from [https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/fbwv-q84y/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD](https://data.oregon.gov/api/views/fbwv-q84y/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD))\n\n2. **Modelled long-term wildfire occurrence probabilities in sagebrush-dominated ecosystems in the western US (1985 to 2019)**: This dataset estimates long-term wildfire occurrence probabilities in sagebrush ecosystems in the western United States, using machine learning techniques and satellite data. It's available in XML format from [https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/metadata/USGS.6023017dd34e31ed20c87329.xml](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/metadata/USGS.6023017dd34e31ed20c87329.xml).\n\n3. **Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) Assessment Wildfire Fire Occurrence Dataset Point Locations from 2001-2024**: This dataset includes point locations of wildfires from 2001 to 2024 for the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. It's available in DOI format from [https://doi.org/10.5066/P97UMU6K](https://doi.org/10.5066/P97UMU6K).\n\n4. **MTBS Wildfire Occurrence**: The Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project assesses the frequency, extent, and magnitude of large wildland fires in the conterminous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico from 1984 to 2018. This dataset is available in a vector point shapefile format from [https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/b766ca0db5a24cccab584caf15f089aa/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/b766ca0db5a24cccab584caf15f089aa/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139).\n\nTo find more precise datasets that match your criteria, I would need more specific information:\n- Are you looking for datasets from a particular organization or producer (e.g., NASA, NOAA)?\n- Would you like to narrow down the search to a specific region within the global scope?\n\nPlease let me know how I can further assist you in finding the right datasets for your needs."

      "description": "These data products are preliminary burn severity assessments derived from post sensor data (including Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI, Sentinel 2A, and Sentinel 2B). The pre-fire and post-fire subsets included were used to create a differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) image. The dNBR image attempts to portray the variation of burn severity within a fire. The severity ratings are influenced by the effects to the canopy.  The severity rating is based upon a composite of the severity to the understory (grass, shrub layers), midstory trees and overstory trees. Because there is often a strong correlation between canopy consumption and soil effects, this algorithm works in many cases for Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams whose objective is a soil burn severity assessment. It is not, however, appropriate in all ecosystems or fires. It is expected that BAER teams will adjust the thresholds to match field observations to produce a soil burn severity.

      "description": "The Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program provides assessments of vegetation conditions following large fires on forested lands. Fire effects are represented by three metrics: percent change in live basal area (BA), percent change in canopy cover (CC), and the standardized Composite Burn Index (CBI). These data are derived from moderate resolution multi-spectral imagery (e.g., Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager or Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument). The Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), which is correlated to the variation of burn severity within a fire, is calculated from a pair of images (pre- and postfire), judiciously selected to capture fire effects. The three-severity metrics are in turn calculated from RdNBR using regression equations developed from and calibrated with historical field data. This map layer is a vector points shapefile of the location of all currently inventoried fires occurring between calendar year 2007 and 2024 for CONUS, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.

      "description": "Wildfires and housing development have increased since the 1990s, presenting unique challenges for fire management. However, it is unclear how the relative influences of housing growth and changing wildfire occurrence have contributed to risk to homes.  We fit a random forest using weather, land cover, topography, and past fire history to predict burn probabilities and uncertainty intervals.  Then, we estimated risk at 1-km resolution and monthly intervals from 1990 through 2019 by combining predicted burn probabilities with housing density across the Southern Rocky Mountains.  We used 3 scenarios to evaluate how housing growth and changes in burn probability influenced risk individually and combined (observed, 1990 housing, and 1990 weather).  This data release includes python scripts used for all processing steps and a readme file describing where to acquire original datasets used by the random forest model, instructions for running the python scripts, and descriptions of outputs.  Preprocessed model inputs were too large to share.  However, raster layers are included for modeled burn probability and risk for the 3 scenarios.",

      "description": "These data were compiled so that annual wildfire could be modelled across the sagebrush region in the western United States. Our goal was to understand how wildfire probability relates to climate and fuel conditions across the entire sagebrush region. To do this we developed a statistical model that represents the relationship between annual wildfire probability and a small number of climate and fuel variables. Specifically, created predictions of wildfire probability using a biologically plausible logistic regression model that related wildfire probability to mean temperature, annual precipitation, the proportion summer precipitation (PSP), and aboveground biomass of annual herbaceous plants and perennial herbaceous plants. The biomass variables were used as proxies for fine fuel availability. These data represent annual fire occurrence in 1 km pixels (i.e. did a given pixel burn that year), predicted wildfire probability, as well as the three year running average (i.e. average across the current and previous two years) of climate and vegetation variables. These data were collected  across the sagebrush region (the extent of the study area is provided by the cell_number_ids.tif file). The climate and vegetation data were compiled using a existing gridded dataset (Daymet) of daily precipitation and temperature, and vegetation data were summaries of annual estimates of aboveground biomass of annual and perennial herbaceous plants from the Rangeland Analysis Platform (https://rangelands.app/). These data can be used to understand spatial and temporal variability in wildfire occurrence and modelled wildfire probability between 1988 and 2019 and how that variability relates to spatial and temporal variability in climate and vegetation.",

[2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",

The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as a Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG), including an updated wildfire-cause standard (approved August 2020). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 2.3 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 180 million acres burned during the 29-year period.
