      "text": "I've conducted a search for XLSX datasets related to river discharge in Africa between 2015 and 2023. Although the search did not yield exact matches with all the specified criteria, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your inquiry.\n\n1. **SAFARI 2000 River Discharge Data (Coe and Olejniczak)**: This dataset is a subset of the CPEP Global River Discharge Data Set, focusing on southern Africa. It contains monthly mean discharge data for various sites. While it doesn't perfectly match your temporal criteria (2015-2023), it does provide valuable information on river discharge in Africa. You can find more information and access the data through the [NASA Earthdata portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=river_discharge_cpep_640&ac=true).\n\n2. **Global River Discharge, 1807-1991, V[ersion]. 1.1 (RivDIS)**: Although this dataset covers a much broader time period (1807-1991) and is not specific to Africa, it does include discharge measurements for several stations on the continent. It might be useful for understanding long-term trends in river discharge. The data can be accessed via the [NASA Earthdata portal](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=rivdis_199&ac=true).\n\n3. **SWOT Sword of Science River Discharge Products Version 1**: This dataset, from the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, provides estimates of river discharge, including both unconstrained and gauge-constrained estimates. While it's a global dataset and not exclusively focused on Africa or the 2015-2023 time frame, it could offer insights into recent river discharge trends. More information is available on the [PODAAC website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\nUnfortunately, none of these datasets specifically match your request for XLSX format and the exact temporal and spatial criteria. To better assist you, could you please provide more details or clarify your requirements? For instance, are you looking for data from a specific river or region within Africa? Are there any particular data providers or sources you prefer? This information will help in narrowing down the search to find the most relevant datasets for your needs."

The SWOT mission is implemented jointly by NASA and Centre National D'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) to provide valuable data and information about the world's oceans and its terrestrial surface water such as lakes, rivers, and wetlands.Sword of Science data products are generated from the open-source SWOT Confluence program and contain river discharge parameter estimates as well as discharge time series for both river reaches and river nodes, following the SWOT River Database (SWORD) structure. Granules from both constrained and unconstrained branches are composed of prior information (e.g., mean annual flow predicted by global hydrological models) and the resulting discharge estimates. Priors and results files for both constrained and unconstrained branches are available in netCDF format. Users are encouraged to reference the SWOT Confluence documentation and notebook tutorials for full documentation of the data structure and variables available.Development of the SWOT Confluence program as well as the Sword of Science data products was funded by NASA’s Advanced Information Systems Technology (AIST) program.",

The data were compiled from RivDIS Version 1.1 (Vorosmarty et al. 1998), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the Brazilian National Department of Water and Electrical Energy.

Data from stations that had less than 3 years of information or that had a basin area less than 5000 square kilometers were excluded from the global data set.
