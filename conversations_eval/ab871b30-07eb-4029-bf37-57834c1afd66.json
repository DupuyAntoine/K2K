      "text": "Based on your request for CSV datasets of precipitation totals in Asia between 1990 and 2000, I've searched through our database to find relevant datasets that match your criteria. Unfortunately, the initial search did not yield datasets that perfectly match your request for precipitation totals specifically in Asia for the period of 1990-2000 in CSV format. However, I can suggest some datasets that might be useful for your research or provide guidance on how to proceed.\n\n1. **Monthly Precipitation Totals 1939-2015**: While not exclusively focused on Asia, this dataset from the Seney National Wildlife Refuge could be useful if you're looking at broader trends. It doesn't directly match your request but could be part of a larger analysis. [Download](https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/DownloadFile/58582?Reference=57628)\n\n2. **Oregon Average Annual Total Precipitation 1991-2020**: This dataset, although focused on Oregon and not Asia, demonstrates how precipitation data can be organized and analyzed over time. It might not be directly applicable but could serve as an example for what you're looking for in terms of data structure. [Access](https://geohub.oregon.gov/documents/oregon-geo::oregon-average-annual-total-precipitation-1991-2020)\n\n3. **NASA Water Vapor Project MEaSUREs (NVAP-M)**: This project includes several datasets related to total precipitable water, which could be indirectly useful for studying precipitation patterns. These datasets cover global areas, including Asia, but might require additional processing to extract specific precipitation totals. [Explore](https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/NVAP-M)\n\nTo refine your search, it would be helpful to know if you're looking for data from specific countries or regions within Asia, as well as the type of precipitation data (e.g., monthly, annual, daily) you're interested in. Additionally, specifying the source or producer of the data could help narrow down the search.\n\nIf you have any more specific details or would like to explore alternative datasets, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further."

These data were gathered during the GPM Cold-season Precipitation Experiment (GCPEx) at the CARE and SkyDive sites in Ontario, Canada during November 7, 2011 - February 21, 2012. These data sets were collected to aid in the achievement of the over arching goal of GCPEx which is to characterize the ability of multi-frequency active and passive microwave sensors to detect and estimate falling snow.",

The 1 degree TPW dataset is a merged ocean product constructed using version 7 (V7) passive microwave geophysical ocean products made publicly available by RSS (www.remss.com). TPW values for this dataset were acquired from the following satellite microwave radiometers: SSM/I F08 through F15, SSMIS F16 and F17, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat. The radiometers used to construct this dataset were were inter-calibrated at the brightness temperature level, while the V7 ocean products were produced using a consistent processing methodology across sensors.",

      "description": "NVAP_OCEAN_Total-Precipitable-Water data set includes only data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and intends to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets. The data set is used for studies of climate change, interannual variability, and independent comparison to other ocean-only data sets. The new NASA Water Vapor Project (NVAP) data sets are produced under the NASA Making Earth Science Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) program and is named NVAP-M. It supersedes the previous NVAP data set. NVAP-M continues the legacy of providing high-quality, model-independent global estimates of total column and layered water vapor. The use of improved, intercalibrated data sets and algorithms that were not available for the heritage NVAP data set results in an improved and extended water vapor data set that is stable enough for climate research and of a resolution appropriate for studies on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The true value of NVAP-M will be seen in outcomes from applied and research users of the data set in various fields. Some initial NVAP-M findings are presented in Vonder Haar et al. (2012). In addition to the time-dependent artifacts present in the previous NVAP data set, a wealth of new data has become available since the last NVAP processing in 2003. These include an additional SSM/I instrument, additional NOAA satellites, the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS)-Aqua Satellite, which carries the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), as well as water vapor information from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites. This extension and reprocessing effort increases the temporal coverage from 14 to 22 (1988-2009) years, making the data set more useful and consistent for investigation of the long-term trends which are hypothesized to occur as Earth warms. In addition to the long-standing daily, 1-degree gridded Total Precipitable Water (TPW) and layered Precipitable Water (PW) products, NVAP-M includes additional products geared towards different scientific needs. Three separate processing streams produced products directed towards specific research goals. These are NVAP-M Climate, designed to provide the most stable water vapor data set over time for use in climate applications, and NVAP-M Weather, designed to provide higher spatial and temporal resolution products for use in studies on shorter time scales as well as weather case studies. Additionally, an ocean-only (NVAP-M Ocean) version includes only data from the SSM/I and is intended to mirror other available SSM/I-only water vapor data sets.",
