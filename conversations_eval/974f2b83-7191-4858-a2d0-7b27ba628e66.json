      "text": "I've searched for datasets that match your request for lake surface area in France between 1980 and 1990 in XLS format. Unfortunately, the provided datasets do not directly match your specific criteria, as they are either in different formats or pertain to different locations and time frames.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with some relevant information that might be helpful. The datasets I've retrieved include information on lake surfaces, water levels, and environmental conditions, but they are mostly from locations outside of France or from different time periods. For example:\n\n1. **Pre SWOT Hydrology Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Area Extent V2**: This dataset provides surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs worldwide, including some in Europe, but it does not specifically focus on France or the 1980-1990 time frame.\n2. **NOAA/WDS Paleoclimatology - Pupuke Lake Holocene Air and Lake Surface Temperature Reconstructions**: This study includes parameters of climate reconstructions related to lake surfaces but is focused on a location in Australia/New Zealand and covers a much broader time span.\n3. **Topographic digital surface models (DSM) for Whiskeytown Lake and surrounding area**: These datasets are specific to a lake in the United States and provide detailed topographic information but do not match your request for France or the specified time period.\n\nTo better assist you, I would like to clarify a few points:\n- Are you looking for data on a specific lake in France, or would a general dataset for all lakes in France be acceptable?\n- Do you have a preferred source or producer for the dataset, such as a French environmental agency or an international organization?\n- Would datasets in formats other than XLS be usable for your purposes, or are there specific requirements for the data format?\n\nPlease provide more details or clarify your requirements so I can conduct a more targeted search or suggest alternative next steps to find the data you need."

      "description": "The Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Extent Mask Time Series are derived from the MODIS instruments. The purpose of this dataset is to provide surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs throughout the globe, with a base temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 meters. With the exception of periods of low-quality input data, these time series will extend across the lifespan of the MODIS multispectral reflectance products, from roughly 2000 to present. These time series will allow us to satisfy the project goal to produce ESDRs of suitable quality to support long-term trend analysis and global water dynamics models for the longest length possible (in most cases, about 20 years, the length of the altimetry record) of key measures of surface water storages and fluxes. This product should be accessible and of direct use to both water managers and the scientific community worldwide, and will allow for improved assessment and modeling of human impact on the global water cycle. These pre SWOT data are derived from satellites to provide hydrological measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will have hydrology as one of its objectives. This dataset does not have the same variables as SWOT, but does provide hydrological measurements with typical quality flagging typical of satellite data. Not only does it provide science information, it can also assist hydrological users new to satellite data with the satellite data formats and variables before SWOT launches.",

Unlike a digital elevation model (DEM), the DSM represents the elevation of the highest object within the bounds of a cell. Vegetation, buildings and other objects have not been removed from the data. In addition, data artifacts resulting from noise and vegetation in the original imagery have not been removed. However, in unvegetated areas such as reservoir shorelines and deltas, the DSM is equivalent to a DEM because it represents the ground surface elevation. The raw imagery used to create this DSM was acquired from a manned aircraft on 2020-11-10. The acquisition flight was conducted by The 111th Group Aerial Photography, using a Hasselblad A6D-100c camera. The imagery was acquired from an approximate altitude of 880 meters (2,900 feet) above ground level, to produce a nominal ground sample distance (pixel size) of 5 centimeters (2 inches). An onboard dual-frequency GPS receiver was used to record the precise time and position of each image. Coordinates for ground control points consisting of photo-identifiable objects were measured independently using survey-grade post-processed kinematic (PPK) GPS.",

      "description": "Clear Lake is a 180 km2 freshwater lake located approximately 120 km northwest of Sacramento in the California Coast Range. The lake is a popular sport-fishing destination, however, there are fish consumption advisories associated with mercury (Hg) contamination for several species. The lake has three arms: a large open-water region to the northwest (Upper Arm), a smaller and narrower region to the southeast (Lower Arm), and the smallest and narrowest region to the east (Oaks Arm). The Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), located on the eastern shore of the Oaks Arm, was mined by underground methods starting in the 1870s and then open-pit methods during the 1920s to 1950s. Since 1992, the SBMM has been a Superfund site managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This former Hg mining area is thought to be the dominant contributor of Hg to Clear Lake and is the focus of continued remediation to minimize Hg impacts to Clear Lake. The SBMM area is an active geothermal area with springs and gas fumaroles. \nClear Lake is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, based on elevated concentrations of nutrients (various forms of nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) that cause excessive algal blooms and periodic fish kills. There are current studies underway (by the University of California, Davis, UCD) to improve the understanding of nutrient cycling within the lake. The UCD group is developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic computer model (https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Blue-Ribbon-Committee-for-the-Rehabilitation-of-Clear-Lake/2022-BRC-Annual-Report-_20230110_DraftFinal.pdf ) of the lake that simulates periodic stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as nutrient dynamics. An effort is planned during 2023-2025 to add mercury cycling to the 3-D model. Monitoring and modeling efforts are being implemented to improve understanding of the ways that nutrient dynamics affect the cycling, transport and bioaccumulation of Hg, which remains poorly understood. \nThis data release documents the results of water-quality sampling during June 2020 through June 2022. It includes three data tables given as machine readable 'comma-separated values' format (*.csv):  1) ‘T1_CL_DataDictionary’, the Data Dictionary, which provides definitions and details related to the other two data tables and includes citations of analytical methods; 2) ‘T2_CL_Discrete_SW’, the discrete-sample surface-water dataset including concentration data for Hg species (including total mercury and methylmercury in dissolved and particulate forms) and nutrients (including several forms of N and P); and 3) ‘T3_CL_QA_SW’, a quality assurance data summary for the discrete water samples. In addition, file ‘Clear Lake Coordinates_SW 2020-22_052324’ provides the sampling locations in a machine-readable geospatial file format (*.kmz).",
