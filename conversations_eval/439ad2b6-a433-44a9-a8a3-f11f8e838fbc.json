      "text": "I've searched for GEOJSON datasets related to lake surface area in North America between 1980 and 1990. Although the exact match is challenging due to the specificity of the request, I've found some relevant datasets that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Pre SWOT Hydrology Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Area Extent V2**: This dataset, available from the NASA Physical Oceanography DAAC, provides global lake and reservoir surface water extent from 2000 to present, derived from MODIS instruments. While it doesn't exactly match your temporal range, it's a valuable resource for understanding lake surface dynamics. You can access it via [https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/CitingPODAAC).\n\n2. **Summary data from Arctic Network water surface area monitoring**: This dataset from the National Park Service includes summary data on water surface area changes in Arctic National Parks, which could be relevant for understanding lake dynamics in North America's Arctic regions. The data is available at [https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/641864?Reference=2275563](https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/DownloadFile/641864?Reference=2275563).\n\n3. **Topographic digital surface model (DSM) for Whiskeytown Lake and surrounding area**: Provided by the USGS, this dataset offers detailed topographic information for Whiskeytown Lake in California, including digital surface models from different years. It might be useful for studying lake surface area changes, albeit for a specific location. You can find it at [https://doi.org/10.5066/P9HEDYNT](https://doi.org/10.5066/P9HEDYNT).\n\n4. **Surface Representing the Floor of Lake Mead and the surrounding area**: Another USGS dataset, this one focuses on Lake Mead, providing detailed bathymetric data. While not directly a GEOJSON file of lake surface area over time, it's a valuable resource for understanding lake morphology. Access it through [https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-320/htmldocs/datacatalog.htm](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-320/htmldocs/datacatalog.htm).\n\nThese datasets were selected for their relevance to lake surface areas in North America, although they might not perfectly match your criteria. For more precise data between 1980 and 1990, I recommend exploring additional sources or contacting the dataset providers for potential archived data.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need assistance with accessing these datasets, please let me know. I'm here to help."

      "description": "The Global Lake/Reservoir Surface Inland Water Extent Mask Time Series are derived from the MODIS instruments. The purpose of this dataset is to provide surface water dynamics for several hundred lakes and reservoirs throughout the globe, with a base temporal resolution of 8 days and a spatial resolution of 500 meters. With the exception of periods of low-quality input data, these time series will extend across the lifespan of the MODIS multispectral reflectance products, from roughly 2000 to present. These time series will allow us to satisfy the project goal to produce ESDRs of suitable quality to support long-term trend analysis and global water dynamics models for the longest length possible (in most cases, about 20 years, the length of the altimetry record) of key measures of surface water storages and fluxes. This product should be accessible and of direct use to both water managers and the scientific community worldwide, and will allow for improved assessment and modeling of human impact on the global water cycle. These pre SWOT data are derived from satellites to provide hydrological measurements. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission will have hydrology as one of its objectives. This dataset does not have the same variables as SWOT, but does provide hydrological measurements with typical quality flagging typical of satellite data. Not only does it provide science information, it can also assist hydrological users new to satellite data with the satellite data formats and variables before SWOT launches.",

The acquisition flight was conducted by The 111th Group Aerial Photography, using a Hasselblad A6D-100c camera. The imagery was acquired from an approximate altitude of 880 meters (2,900 feet) above ground level, to produce a nominal ground sample distance (pixel size) of 5 centimeters (2 inches).

      "description": "Lake Mead is a large interstate reservoir located in the Mojave Desert of southeastern Nevada and northwestern Arizona.  It was impounded in 1935 by the construction of Hoover Dam and is one of a series of multi-purpose reservoirs on the Colorado River.  The lake extends 183 km from the mouth of the Grand Canyon to Black Canyon, the site of Hoover Dam, and provides water for residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and other non-agricultural users in communities across the southwestern United States.  Extensive research has been conducted on Lake Mead, but a majority of the studies have involved determining levels of anthropogenic contaminants such as synthetic organic compounds, heavy metals and dissolved ions, furans/dioxins, and nutrient loading in lake water, sediment, and biota (Preissler, et al., 1998; Bevans et al, 1996; Bevans et al., 1998; Covay and Leiker, 1998; LaBounty and Horn, 1997; Paulson, 1981).  By contrast, little work has focused on the sediments in the lake and the processes of deposition (Gould, 1951).  To address these questions, sidescan-sonar imagery and high-resolution seismic-reflection profiles were collected throughout Lake Mead by the USGS in cooperation with researchers from University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV).  These data allow a detailed mapping of the surficial geology and the distribution and thickness of sediment that has accumulated in the lake since the completion of Hoover Dam.  Results indicate that the accumulation of post-impoundment sediment is primarily restricted to former river and stream beds that are now submerged below the lake while the margins of the lake appear to be devoid of post-impoundment sediment.  The sediment cover along the original Colorado River bed is continuous and is typically greater than 10 m thick through much of its length.  Sediment thickness in some areas exceeds 35 m while the smaller tributary valleys typically are filled with less than 4 m of sediment.  Away from the river beds that are now covered with post-impoundment sediment, pre-impoundment alluvial deposits and rock outcrops are still exposed on the lake floor.",

      "description": "Clear Lake is a 180 km2 freshwater lake located approximately 120 km northwest of Sacramento in the California Coast Range. The lake is a popular sport-fishing destination, however, there are fish consumption advisories associated with mercury (Hg) contamination for several species. The lake has three arms: a large open-water region to the northwest (Upper Arm), a smaller and narrower region to the southeast (Lower Arm), and the smallest and narrowest region to the east (Oaks Arm). The Sulfur Bank Mercury Mine (SBMM), located on the eastern shore of the Oaks Arm, was mined by underground methods starting in the 1870s and then open-pit methods during the 1920s to 1950s. Since 1992, the SBMM has been a Superfund site managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This former Hg mining area is thought to be the dominant contributor of Hg to Clear Lake and is the focus of continued remediation to minimize Hg impacts to Clear Lake. The SBMM area is an active geothermal area with springs and gas fumaroles. \nClear Lake is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, based on elevated concentrations of nutrients (various forms of nitrogen, N, and phosphorus, P) that cause excessive algal blooms and periodic fish kills. There are current studies underway (by the University of California, Davis, UCD) to improve the understanding of nutrient cycling within the lake. The UCD group is developing a three-dimensional hydrodynamic computer model (https://resources.ca.gov/-/media/CNRA-Website/Files/Initiatives/Blue-Ribbon-Committee-for-the-Rehabilitation-of-Clear-Lake/2022-BRC-Annual-Report-_20230110_DraftFinal.pdf ) of the lake that simulates periodic stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen as well as nutrient dynamics. An effort is planned during 2023-2025 to add mercury cycling to the 3-D model. Monitoring and modeling efforts are being implemented to improve understanding of the ways that nutrient dynamics affect the cycling, transport and bioaccumulation of Hg, which remains poorly understood. \nThis data release documents the results of water-quality sampling during June 2020 through June 2022. It includes three data tables given as machine readable 'comma-separated values' format (*.csv):  1) ‘T1_CL_DataDictionary’, the Data Dictionary, which provides definitions and details related to the other two data tables and includes citations of analytical methods; 2) ‘T2_CL_Discrete_SW’, the discrete-sample surface-water dataset including concentration data for Hg species (including total mercury and methylmercury in dissolved and particulate forms) and nutrients (including several forms of N and P); and 3) ‘T3_CL_QA_SW’, a quality assurance data summary for the discrete water samples. In addition, file ‘Clear Lake Coordinates_SW 2020-22_052324’ provides the sampling locations in a machine-readable geospatial file format (*.kmz).",
