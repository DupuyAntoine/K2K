      "text": "You're looking for JSON datasets related to snow cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean, specifically for the period between 2010 and 2020. After conducting a search, I found several datasets that might be relevant to your query, although none directly match the specific criteria of focusing on the Atlantic Ocean and being in JSON format. However, these datasets are related to snow cover extent and are from reputable sources, which could be useful for your research:\n\n1. **Rutgers Northern Hemisphere 24 km Weekly Snow Cover Extent, September 1980 Onward, Version 1** - This dataset provides weekly snow cover extent for the Northern Hemisphere, which includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean, from September 1980 onward at a 24 km resolution. It's available in NetCDF format, not JSON, but it could be a valuable resource for understanding snow cover patterns over time. [Download from NSIDC](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10035/).\n\n2. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent** - This dataset offers monthly North American snow cover extent derived from weekly values. While it's not specifically focused on the Atlantic Ocean, it covers a broad area that includes coastal regions. The data format isn't JSON, but it's a comprehensive resource for studying snow cover and sea ice extent. [More information from NOAA](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html).\n\n3. **MEaSUREs Northern Hemisphere Terrestrial Snow Cover Extent Daily 25km EASE-Grid 2.0 V001** - Part of the NASA MEaSUREs program, this dataset provides daily Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent at a 25 km resolution. It includes data represented by four different variables, all related to snow cover extent. Although it's not in JSON format and focuses on the Northern Hemisphere rather than the Atlantic Ocean specifically, it's a detailed resource for snow cover research. [Access through NASA](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=10.5067%2FMEASURES%2FCRYOSPHERE%2Fnsidc-0530.001).\n\n4. **ISLSCP II Northern Hemisphere Monthly Snow Cover Extent** - Derived from the NSIDC Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Weekly Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent product, this dataset provides monthly snow cover extent. It's designed to study Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent. The data format and specific focus on the Atlantic Ocean don't match your request, but it's a valuable dataset for broader snow cover studies. [Available through Earthdata](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?q=snow_cover_xdeg_982&ac=true).\n\nTo better assist you, could you please provide more details about your specific requirements, such as the resolution or granularity of the snow cover extent data you're looking for? Additionally, are you interested in a particular region within the Atlantic Ocean, such as the North Atlantic or areas around specific islands? This information would help in narrowing down the search for more relevant datasets."

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",

      "description": "This dataset provides estimates of maximum snow cover extent (SCE) and snow depth for each 8-day composite period from 2001 to 2017 at 1 km resolution across Alaska. The study area covers the majority land area of Alaska except for areas covered by perennial ice/snow or open water. A downscaling scheme was used in which Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis 0.5 degree snow depth data were interpolated to a finer 1 km spatial grid.  In the methods used, the downscaling scheme incorporated MODIS SCE (MOD10A2) to better account for the influence of local topography on the 1km snow distribution patterns.  For MODIS cloud-contaminated pixels, persistent and patchy cloud cover conditions were improved by applying an elevation-based spatial filtering algorithm to predict snow occurrence.  Cloud-free MODIS SCE data were then used to downscale MERRA-2 snow depth data.  For each snow-covered 1 km pixel indicated by the MODIS data, the snow depth was estimated based on the snow depth of the neighboring MERRA-2 0.5 grid cell, with weights predicted using a spatial filter.",

The land cover classification maps feature between three and six classes common to mountainous regions and integral for accurate stereo snow depth mapping: illuminated snow, shaded snow, vegetation, exposed surfaces, surface water, and clouds. Also included are Landsat and MODSCAG fSCA map products. The source imagery for these data are the Maxar WorldView-2 and Maxar WorldView-3 Level-1B 8-band multispectral images, orthorectified and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance. These Level-1B images are available under the NGA NextView/EnhancedView license.",
