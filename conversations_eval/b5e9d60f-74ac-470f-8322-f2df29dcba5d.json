      "text": "You are looking for datasets of ice cover extent in the Atlantic Ocean, specifically for the period between 2010 and 2020, and in CSV format. After conducting a search, several relevant datasets were found that may match your requirements.\n\n1. **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**: This dataset, available from NOAA, provides weekly snow cover and sea ice extent data for the Northern Hemisphere, including the Atlantic Ocean, from 1966 to 2023. While it covers a broader area and time span than your specific request, it can be filtered to focus on the Atlantic Ocean and the years 2010-2020. The data is available in various formats, but it can be converted to CSV for analysis.\n\n2. **Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstructions, 1905-2020**: Although this dataset from NSIDC focuses on Antarctic sea ice, it's worth noting for its comprehensive coverage of sea ice extent over a long period. However, for data specific to the Atlantic Ocean, this might not directly match your needs unless you're looking for comparative data or methodologies that could be applied to Atlantic sea ice studies.\n\n3. **Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent - Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-NH)**: This dataset provides daily sea ice extent and edge boundary for the Northern Hemisphere, which includes parts of the Atlantic Ocean. It's available from NSIDC and covers a time span that includes your requested years. The data comes in ASCII text files and can be easily converted to CSV format.\n\n4. **Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration, 1850 Onward**: This historical dataset offers monthly gridded sea ice concentration, starting from 1850, with data sourced from historical observations and satellite passive microwave data from 1979 onwards. It's a comprehensive resource for studying sea ice changes over time, including the Atlantic Ocean, and is available in NetCDF format, which can be converted to CSV for specific analysis needs.\n\nTo download these datasets or find more information:\n- For **Northern Hemisphere EASE-Grid Snow Cover and Sea Ice Extent**, visit [http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/data.snowcover.html).\n- For **Seasonal Antarctic Sea Ice Extent Reconstructions, 1905-2020**, go to [https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10039/](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10039/).\n- For **Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent - Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-NH)**, see [https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02186/](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02186/).\n- For **Gridded Monthly Sea Ice Extent and Concentration, 1850 Onward**, visit [https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10010_V2/](https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G10010_V2/).\n\nEach of these datasets was selected for its relevance to sea ice extent, coverage of the Atlantic Ocean (either directly or as part of a broader geographic area), and availability of data within the 2010-2020 timeframe. If you're looking for more targeted data or specific to the Atlantic Ocean's ice cover extent, you might need to filter these datasets or consider additional sources that specifically monitor ice conditions in the Atlantic.\n\nIf you have any further clarification questions or need assistance with dataset filtering or format conversion, feel free to ask."

      "description": "This dataset is a single polyline file that depicts the boundary of the Little Ice Age maximum advance of the terminus of Exit and Paradise Glaciers. The data were collected and digitized for the purpose of identifying, as nearly as possible, the maximum extent of the Little Ice Age (1800s) expansion of the terminal margin of Exit Glacier and Paradise Glacier. Fragments of moraines previously dated by other investigators capture only a small portion of the boundary of that glacier expansion, so this dataset was developed to provide a complete map of the LIA maximum boundary, without requiring definitive dating of any particular portion of the boundary. It is assumed that the entire mapped boundary was occupied by glacier ice sometime during the LIA maximum (nominally 1815-1899 A.D.), but within that time range some portions of the glacier may have reached their maximum extents before or after others.",

The original data set was the first representation of combined snow and sea ice measurements derived from satellite observations for the period of record. Designed to facilitate study of Northern Hemisphere seasonal fluctuations of snow cover and sea ice extent, the original NSIDC data set also includes monthly climatologies describing average extent, probability of occurrence, and variance.This data set shows the extent of snow on the land at a variety of scales (1.0 degree, 0.5 degree, 0.25 degree). The values represent the percentage of days in each month where snow was present -- 100 means 100% of the month, 80 means 80% of the month, etc. There are 4 .zip files provided. Missing data is represented by -99 for water and -88 for land. The data were originally in a yearly tabular format. The file was converted to multi-scale maps by plotting each point in the tabular data onto a map of -99 (water) and -88 (land) created from the standard ISLSCP II Land/Sea Mask.",
